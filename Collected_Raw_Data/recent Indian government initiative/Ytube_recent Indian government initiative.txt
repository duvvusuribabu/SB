May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys

Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳

Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind

Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother

Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys

Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.

If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.

India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.

Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.

Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.

Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.

Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.

Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.

Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people.

Respect China increasing...

Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.

Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace

NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.

The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".

Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik

This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS

Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir. 
Love 
🤣
Source : Trust Me Bro
can v believe     them?
boycottFifa2022
Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.

Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir. 
Love 
🤣

can v believe     them?
boycottFifa2022
Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Indian Media 
How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Indian Media 
How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind
😂
Lols looked upn Todi face 
Matlab kuch bhi 
New foot ball coach has emerged Representing Dhoha for additional funds...
in our religion Islam it is an obligation for you to respond to your Muslim brother invitation.
Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir. 
Love 
🤣

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Indian Media 
How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind
😂
Lols looked upn Todi face 
Matlab kuch bhi 
New foot ball coach has emerged Representing Dhoha for additional funds...
in our religion Islam it is an obligation for you to respond to your Muslim brother invitation.
Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir. 
Love 
🤣
Source : Trust Me Bro
can v believe     them?
boycottFifa2022
Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Indian Media 
How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind
😂
Lols looked upn Todi face 
Matlab kuch bhi 
New foot ball coach has emerged Representing Dhoha for additional funds...
in our religion Islam it is an obligation for you to respond to your Muslim brother invitation.
Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..
Zakir is not bad modi is  the world knows this
Evil messenger.. how high he flies / jumps…  he’s not going  bck to muslim earth…  cos there is only mother earth….
Qatar paxistan ideology both are same only strategy used are different
Dr.zakir naik .
what action will the Qatar goverment take against those who sent  invitiation to Zakir Naik....
Chaddis will say masterstroke but its Qatar the Baap Of masterstroke.  Invited but wouldnt accept it and wouldnt spoil bilateral Relation with India. 1 teer kahi NishaNe.. Wah Qatar Wah Mann gaye apko, Vishwa Guru ko Chunna Laga Diye. 
Puri duniya me bht fraud log hai par sab 1 k picche hai
Good job Qatar 
If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!

Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.

Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?

INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...

If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

When you cant compete with the guy then start calling him Terrorist wow. We Love Zakir Naik.
Ye log fifa se jyada mujhub game khelne me laga hua hai
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind

Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?

Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah

Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football

If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that

Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!

Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰

Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???

Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind

Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..

If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫
Kay insaan hai    ........banda qatar mai aur qatal India mai 
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace

Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...

Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...

God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!

Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.

Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?

INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...

May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫
Kay insaan hai    ........banda qatar mai aur qatal India mai 
Not invited but seated in the VVIP box?
Gobar waalo
Joker 
Summon Qatar diplomat please
Why gender neutrality is not respected in FIFA WC site (Qatar)?
Dear BJP, please reinstate Nupur Sharma.
What about Hindu swami who said rape Muslim women .. why he was not in jail .. oh bcz he is Hindu...
Islam will not stop by stopping Zakir naik
Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.
Qatar and All Muslims  in the world are same.....we all love islam... We are muslim
India didn't even qualify for the world cup,so you can't expect fifa to invite you
[ آل عمران: 54]
Who believed in HT , why the hell Doha needs to inform India????They know what they are doing, they don’t need dictations of anyone. 
there are millions of Indian labor in Qatar
Proud to be Muslim , Proud on Zakir Naik ..
Qatar ka per kutar ne wala hai
Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir. 
Love 
🤣
Source : Trust Me Bro
can v believe     them?
boycottFifa2022
Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Indian Media 
How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind
😂
Lols looked upn Todi face 
Matlab kuch bhi 
New foot ball coach has emerged Representing Dhoha for additional funds...
in our religion Islam it is an obligation for you to respond to your Muslim brother invitation.
Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..
Zakir is not bad modi is  the world knows this
Evil messenger.. how high he flies / jumps…  he’s not going  bck to muslim earth…  cos there is only mother earth….
Qatar paxistan ideology both are same only strategy used are different
Dr.zakir naik .
what action will the Qatar goverment take against those who sent  invitiation to Zakir Naik....
Chaddis will say masterstroke but its Qatar the Baap Of masterstroke.  Invited but wouldnt accept it and wouldnt spoil bilateral Relation with India. 1 teer kahi NishaNe.. Wah Qatar Wah Mann gaye apko, Vishwa Guru ko Chunna Laga Diye. 
Puri duniya me bht fraud log hai par sab 1 k picche hai
Good job Qatar 
If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Reasons to boycott this WC:
Incomplete information why is Indian government so weak?
Showing add inside video while streaming video is not feels nice. Add is covering most of the screen portion and news can't be read. It's disgusting. Losing interest to watch the news. I suggest better your change it. 
☝
Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫
Kay insaan hai    ........banda qatar mai aur qatal India mai

Summon Qatar diplomat please
Why gender neutrality is not respected in FIFA WC site (Qatar)?
Dear BJP, please reinstate Nupur Sharma.
What about Hindu swami who said rape Muslim women .. why he was not in jail .. oh bcz he is Hindu...
Islam will not stop by stopping Zakir naik
Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.
Qatar and All Muslims  in the world are same.....we all love islam... We are muslim
India didn't even qualify for the world cup,so you can't expect fifa to invite you
[ آل عمران: 54]
Who believed in HT , why the hell Doha needs to inform India????They know what they are doing, they don’t need dictations of anyone. 
there are millions of Indian labor in Qatar
Proud to be Muslim , Proud on Zakir Naik ..
Qatar ka per kutar ne wala hai
Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.
All these Arabic countries are showing their might because of the oil reserves
We will send u more THAN five million live in khalij.
Why doesn't Qatar request help from its biggest shareholder Vashudev ?

Why Indian Government is not taking action against Zakir for recruiting people for isisi ?

Long Live Dr.Zaki Naik 
Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!

Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?

Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.

Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness...

Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind

Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..
Zakir is not bad modi is  the world knows this

Dr.zakir naik .
what action will the Qatar goverment take against those who sent  invitiation to Zakir Naik....
Chaddis will say masterstroke but its Qatar the Baap Of masterstroke.  Invited but wouldnt accept it and wouldnt spoil bilateral Relation with India. 1 teer kahi NishaNe.. Wah Qatar Wah Mann gaye apko, Vishwa Guru ko Chunna Laga Diye.

Good job Qatar 
If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Showing add inside video while streaming video is not feels nice. Add is covering most of the screen portion and news can't be read. It's disgusting. Losing interest to watch the news. I suggest better your change it. 
☝
Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Islam will not stop by stopping Zakir naik
Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.
Qatar and All Muslims  in the world are same.....we all love islam... We are muslim
India didn't even qualify for the world cup,so you can't expect fifa to invite you

Qatar ka per kutar ne wala hai
Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.
All these Arabic countries are showing their might because of the oil reserves
We will send u more THAN five million live in khalij.
Why doesn't Qatar request help from its biggest shareholder Vashudev ?

Long Live Dr.Zaki Naik 
Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!
So it.means it was an Indian propegenda & nothing....hahaha

So what if he's invited? No one's business period!
@Islamic Knowledge Base  who is this Lah guy?
IT IS NOT NEWSPAPER IT IS TOILET PAPER
Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!" (Quran, 23:91)
There is no stuff in your reports. Only loud music and scripts. You should have a voice over atleast
Never bow down to the hypocricy of west
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone

God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!

Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that,

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.

Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..
Zakir is not bad modi is  the world knows this
Evil messenger.. how high he flies / jumps…  he’s not going  bck to muslim earth…  cos there is only mother earth….

May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Andhaa bhaktho ka dil Jalra hai Modi Ji ko koi taklip nahi andha bhaktho ko dard hora hai Use for Burnel Zakir naik haters 
Fugitive only according to BJP not Everyone 
Real hero Zakir naik 
Zakir naik is not a hate speech preacher.
What india gonna do? Sanction qatar? 
200 crore peoples love zakir naik....

Reasons to boycott this WC:
Incomplete information why is Indian government so weak?
Showing add inside video while streaming video is not feels nice. Add is covering most of the screen portion and news can't be read. It's disgusting. Losing interest to watch the news. I suggest better your change it. 
☝
Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫
Kay insaan hai    ........banda qatar mai aur qatal India mai 
Not invited but seated in the VVIP box?
Gobar waalo
Joker 
Summon Qatar diplomat please
Why gender neutrality is not respected in FIFA WC site (Qatar)?
Dear BJP, please reinstate Nupur Sharma.
What about Hindu swami who said rape Muslim women .. why he was not in jail .. oh bcz he is Hindu...
Islam will not stop by stopping Zakir naik
Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.
Qatar and All Muslims  in the world are same.....we all love islam... We are muslim
India didn't even qualify for the world cup,so you can't expect fifa to invite you
[ آل عمران: 54]
Who believed in HT , why the hell Doha needs to inform India????They know what they are doing, they don’t need dictations of anyone. 
there are millions of Indian labor in Qatar
Proud to be Muslim , Proud on Zakir Naik ..
Qatar ka per kutar ne wala hai
Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.
All these Arabic countries are showing their might because of the oil reserves
We will send u more THAN five million live in khalij.
Why doesn't Qatar request help from its biggest shareholder Vashudev ?
Qatart ye modi ko safai kyun de raha hai
Why Indian Government is not taking action against Zakir for recruiting people for isisi ?
I love Qatar 🇶🇦 
BJP ko chanda do phir kahi bhi bhaag jao chahe Bahamas ho, London ho ya Malaysia. 
Ek kahawat h na begane ke shadi me abdullah deewana ab smjh jao kon abdullah kon deewana
Long Live Dr.Zaki Naik 
Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!
So it.means it was an Indian propegenda & nothing....hahaha
Is this news? The format is awful for a simple statement
india duniya ka sabse amir country hai....  Aisa vau khata hai,,,,  qatar ka ek bal bhe baka nehi kar sakta india udhar jakar jo kamata hai lath marke nikal dega toh kya karega
Seems like too many bhajiya and chatni eaten today.
Ramful community always spreads hate by Hindustan times
modi rss sarkar rss bajarandal atangbadey barwaku khuch nahi karti i love you zakir naik 
What India can do on this matter… Clutch on the fabricated cases against Dr. Zakir and bark…
So what if he's invited? No one's business period!
@Islamic Knowledge Base  who is this Lah guy?
IT IS NOT NEWSPAPER IT IS TOILET PAPER
Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!" (Quran, 23:91)
There is no stuff in your reports. Only loud music and scripts. You should have a voice over atleast
Never bow down to the hypocricy of west
Quttor.  ..paak....malasia.....turki...nexus ⚲
Ye sab Qatar ka dogalapan hai.
quran translation in urdu search for youtube
Like bruh get over with it. So what if qatar invited him? Doesnt means we should start fighting . Can't digest it , So don't watch it .Simple solution brothers.
He should be handed over to India.
Well Qatar should hand him over to India, not providing safe heaven. Other situations govt is apt to act why not this one. No lamé excuses
Qathar 
That man shouldn't be invited nomans events or otherwise..
Modi call Biden and say Zakir Naik Hellfire missile
Bycot fifa world cup
India should have boycotted FIFA.
Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart 
we proud of Dr Zakir naik
How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.
Why that make you jealous? Ask him  questions come right path  to peace.
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!

Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles

Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.

Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?

INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.

May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.

Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!

Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart

How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.

May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.

They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.

What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.

Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir. 
Love 
🤣
Source : Trust Me Bro
can v believe     them?
boycottFifa2022
Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Indian Media 
How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind
😂
Lols looked upn Todi face 
Matlab kuch bhi 
New foot ball coach has emerged Representing Dhoha for additional funds...
in our religion Islam it is an obligation for you to respond to your Muslim brother invitation.
Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..
Zakir is not bad modi is  the world knows this
Evil messenger.. how high he flies / jumps…  he’s not going  bck to muslim earth…  cos there is only mother earth….
Qatar paxistan ideology both are same only strategy used are different
Dr.zakir naik .
what action will the Qatar goverment take against those who sent  invitiation to Zakir Naik....
Chaddis will say masterstroke but its Qatar the Baap Of masterstroke.  Invited but wouldnt accept it and wouldnt spoil bilateral Relation with India. 1 teer kahi NishaNe.. Wah Qatar Wah Mann gaye apko, Vishwa Guru ko Chunna Laga Diye. 
Puri duniya me bht fraud log hai par sab 1 k picche hai
Good job Qatar 
If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.

Reasons to boycott this WC:
Incomplete information why is Indian government so weak?
Showing add inside video while streaming video is not feels nice. Add is covering most of the screen portion and news can't be read. It's disgusting. Losing interest to watch the news. I suggest better your change it. 
☝
Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Why gender neutrality is not respected in FIFA WC site (Qatar)?
Dear BJP, please reinstate Nupur Sharma.
What about Hindu swami who said rape Muslim women .. why he was not in jail .. oh bcz he is Hindu...
Islam will not stop by stopping Zakir naik
Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.
Qatar and All Muslims  in the world are same.....we all love islam... We are muslim
India didn't even qualify for the world cup,so you can't expect fifa to invite you
[ آل عمران: 54]
Who believed in HT , why the hell Doha needs to inform India????They know what they are doing, they don’t need dictations of anyone. 
there are millions of Indian labor in Qatar
Proud to be Muslim , Proud on Zakir Naik ..
Qatar ka per kutar ne wala hai
Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.
All these Arabic countries are showing their might because of the oil reserves
We will send u more THAN five million live in khalij.

Long Live Dr.Zaki Naik 
Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!
So it.means it was an Indian propegenda & nothing....hahaha
Is this news? The format is awful for a simple statement
india duniya ka sabse amir country hai....  Aisa vau khata hai,,,,  qatar ka ek bal bhe baka nehi kar sakta india udhar jakar jo kamata hai lath marke nikal dega toh kya karega

So what if he's invited? No one's business period!
@Islamic Knowledge Base  who is this Lah guy?
IT IS NOT NEWSPAPER IT IS TOILET PAPER
Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!" (Quran, 23:91)
There is no stuff in your reports. Only loud music and scripts. You should have a voice over atleast

He should be handed over to India.
Well Qatar should hand him over to India, not providing safe heaven. Other situations govt is apt to act why not this one. No lamé excuses
Qathar 
That man shouldn't be invited nomans events or otherwise..
Modi call Biden and say Zakir Naik Hellfire missile
Bycot fifa world cup
India should have boycotted FIFA.
Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart 
we proud of Dr Zakir naik
How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.
Why that make you jealous? Ask him  questions come right path  to peace.
Modi pls recall indian from g c c country possible or not
Stop calling it qatar call it gutter
Taqyia
Mashallah
Ambedkar was right
Those who saing shame on Qatar.....you people first say your govt to be in shame...why the people of other countries have to go to other countries and work for living...it means your govt failed to give employment...your govt can spend thousand thousand crores in election..but can't provide better living, better employment...shame on you people...who stays busy in finding others faults...instead of own fault.

What happened to Nupur Sharma case and another hate speech promoter of BJP officials 
First of all, why is Qatar playing aplogetic is out of my understanding. Qatar is the host and can invite anyone do its discretion. There are more hate speakers in India under the banner of Hinduvta and no action is taken against them
Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....
Who are you? They will Invite whomever they want
Where is murder fugitive dawood Ibrahim, theft fugitive vijay maliya, how could be 8 years prisoner committed in crime pregaya thagur  in your parliament she killed 35 people
If an Hindu poojari can attend an mall inauguration by Mr. Modi then why Dr. Nailk( I have no idea who this man is. ) should be kept out of Qatar ceremony. Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.
I support Zakir Naik Sahab because Nupur was not get jailed.
This is pure hate he left still they are after him because he knows their religion more themselves 
Third country who else can be PKMKB
This is another monster of the planet who thinks he can control the minds of his followers

May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!

Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰

Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness...

Now these days godi media has no news so

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind

Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..

Chaddis will say masterstroke but its Qatar the Baap Of masterstroke.  Invited but wouldnt accept it and wouldnt spoil bilateral Relation with India. 1 teer kahi NishaNe.. Wah Qatar Wah Mann gaye apko, Vishwa Guru ko Chunna Laga Diye.

Good job Qatar 
If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.

Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!
So it.means it was an Indian propegenda & nothing....hahaha

Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!" (Quran, 23:91)

Bycot fifa world cup
India should have boycotted FIFA.
Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart 
we proud of Dr Zakir naik
How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.
Why that make you jealous? Ask him  questions come right path  to peace.

Do not even response to indian....
What happened to Nupur Sharma case and another hate speech promoter of BJP officials 
First of all, why is Qatar playing aplogetic is out of my understanding. Qatar is the host and can invite anyone do its discretion. There are more hate speakers in India under the banner of Hinduvta and no action is taken against them
Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....
Who are you? They will Invite whomever they want
Where is murder fugitive dawood Ibrahim, theft fugitive vijay maliya, how could be 8 years prisoner committed in crime pregaya thagur  in your parliament she killed 35 people
If an Hindu poojari can attend an mall inauguration by Mr. Modi then why Dr. Nailk( I have no idea who this man is. ) should be kept out of Qatar ceremony. Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.
I support Zakir Naik Sahab because Nupur was not get jailed.
This is pure hate he left still they are after him because he knows their religion more themselves 
Third country who else can be PKMKB
This is another monster of the planet who thinks he can control the minds of his followers
Indian Godi media 
Dum hai Modiji mein ?
I am sure modi govt will follow mossad and start eliminating these fugitives in foreign nations.
No country but ONLY R S S 
Modi islamofobiya  Brand ambassador r of  India Dr zair super hero's from India
Dear hindu brother, Our Lord/creator is One we muslim only giving puja to One true God/Issor. We only bow down our to the only true issor/God.
Qater king say qater no invide jakir naik
21 St century not a 6th century (tribals culture)
Let Modi cry over this issues!!
WHAT HAPPENED TO HUMAN RIGHTS. THERE ARE SNAKES IN QATAR. this should be real title of book. SERPENT IN QATAR
Ex muslim sahil YouTube channel dekhoon 
Ban Qatar
what a nonsense reply!! Private visit ?? If Modi govt believes this nonsense then whole world will laugh at them.  Just recall Dhankar immediately right now.
We stand with zakir Naik against fascist India. 
Ex muslim sahil YouTube channel dekhoon
Can’t digest it. Zakir naik is not a football fan. According to him football is haram . And he is a word to word follower of Islam. They way they said yes to beer and lgbtq before and imposed a ban just before two days it’s hard to believe whatever they r saying.
If india and Qatar relation gets worse it will never hurt qatar nobody need India Needs Qatar. Indian employees in qatar make so much money in Indian economy
P / p  ?
Dalit Naik sure but what about the 10000+ dead Indians and the thousands more trapped as indentured labourers. Maybe Modi should’ve talked them about that instead?
That dog should be haunted now.....
Whatever and however you fools do ..Allah will safeguard his servants
Who cares if Indians gonna boycott it. Football is not even considered a sports game in India, billions of people around to watch soccer even if Indians don't want to
Oil over game over then start grazing ships again
Boycott Qatar.
India will trap him very soom
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone

How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind

Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...

If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.

Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!

Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!"

Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart

How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.
Why that make you jealous? Ask him  questions come right path  to peace.

First of all, why is Qatar playing aplogetic is out of my understanding. Qatar is the host and can invite anyone do its discretion. There are more hate speakers in India under the banner of Hinduvta and no action is taken against them
Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....
Who are you? They will Invite whomever they want

Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.
I support Zakir Naik Sahab because Nupur was not get jailed.
This is pure hate he left still they are after him because he knows their religion more themselves

Can’t digest it. Zakir naik is not a football fan. According to him football is haram . And he is a word to word follower of Islam. They way they said yes to beer and lgbtq before and imposed a ban just before two days it’s hard to believe whatever they r saying.
If india and Qatar relation gets worse it will never hurt qatar nobody need India Needs Qatar. Indian employees in qatar make so much money in Indian economy
P / p  ?
Dalit Naik sure but what about the 10000+ dead Indians and the thousands more trapped as indentured labourers. Maybe Modi should’ve talked them about that instead?
That dog should be haunted now.....

Who cares if Indians gonna boycott it. Football is not even considered a sports game in India, billions of people around to watch soccer even if Indians don't want to

Government of India is scared of Zakir Naik hehe Love you Dr.Zakir
Dr Zakir Naik is not a bigot. He’s a practicing Muslim. Who’s only purveying and propagating the beliefs that he is a trained master and as a torch bearer of his particular belief. Why are we going after him as an individual when the fact of the matter is he’s representing a mindset of over 2 billion people across the globe, therefore he is presenting his views which finds acceptance in a significant cross-section of the muslim population which has Islam as its state religion and knowing fully well that these are his views and these are this contributions to religions peace and harmony. The Arabs have chosen to welcome him to such a global event apart from the fact that it perhaps represents a resounding slap to the Indian state which threw respectable people like Nupur Sharma, A Raja under the bus without giving an opportunity to prove their position before the court of law. It’s for the Indian state to ask itself if they have the confidence to hold on their position and walk their talk to speak their mind. 
🤣
Lindus ki jali na.
Fear on the air.the nightmares is on the way......!
Why Qatar not deporting Zakir to India for trial.
India should severe all ties with Qatar.This is failure of Modi govt.
India must Boycott Qatar, put Qatar in fanatic list like  Pakistan, Turkey .
This is purely Modi channel
Hate speeches???
False information
jalte raho
Zakir naik 
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.

Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.

If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone

As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya

We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah

Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.

In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth

Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Why they are scared of zakir naik

Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that,

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.

Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..

May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Reasons to boycott this WC:
Incomplete information why is Indian government so weak?
Showing add inside video while streaming video is not feels nice. Add is covering most of the screen portion and news can't be read. It's disgusting. Losing interest to watch the news. I suggest better your change it. 
☝
Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Why gender neutrality is not respected in FIFA WC site (Qatar)?
Dear BJP, please reinstate Nupur Sharma.
What about Hindu swami who said rape Muslim women .. why he was not in jail .. oh bcz he is Hindu...
Islam will not stop by stopping Zakir naik
Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.
Qatar and All Muslims  in the world are same.....we all love islam... We are muslim
India didn't even qualify for the world cup,so you can't expect fifa to invite you
[ آل عمران: 54]
Who believed in HT , why the hell Doha needs to inform India????They know what they are doing, they don’t need dictations of anyone. 
there are millions of Indian labor in Qatar
Proud to be Muslim , Proud on Zakir Naik ..
Qatar ka per kutar ne wala hai
Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.
All these Arabic countries are showing their might because of the oil reserves
We will send u more THAN five million live in khalij.

Long Live Dr.Zaki Naik 
Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!
So it.means it was an Indian propegenda & nothing....hahaha
Is this news? The format is awful for a simple statement
india duniya ka sabse amir country hai....  Aisa vau khata hai,,,,  qatar ka ek bal bhe baka nehi kar sakta india udhar jakar jo kamata hai lath marke nikal dega toh kya karega

So what if he's invited? No one's business period!
@Islamic Knowledge Base  who is this Lah guy?
IT IS NOT NEWSPAPER IT IS TOILET PAPER
Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!" (Quran, 23:91)
There is no stuff in your reports. Only loud music and scripts. You should have a voice over atleast

He should be handed over to India.
Well Qatar should hand him over to India, not providing safe heaven. Other situations govt is apt to act why not this one. No lamé excuses
Qathar 
That man shouldn't be invited nomans events or otherwise..
Modi call Biden and say Zakir Naik Hellfire missile
Bycot fifa world cup
India should have boycotted FIFA.
Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart 
we proud of Dr Zakir naik
How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.
Why that make you jealous? Ask him  questions come right path  to peace.
Modi pls recall indian from g c c country possible or not
Stop calling it qatar call it gutter

Those who saing shame on Qatar.....you people first say your govt to be in shame...why the people of other countries have to go to other countries and work for living...it means your govt failed to give employment...your govt can spend thousand thousand crores in election..but can't provide better living, better employment...shame on you people...who stays busy in finding others faults...instead of own fault.

What happened to Nupur Sharma case and another hate speech promoter of BJP officials 
First of all, why is Qatar playing aplogetic is out of my understanding. Qatar is the host and can invite anyone do its discretion. There are more hate speakers in India under the banner of Hinduvta and no action is taken against them
Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....
Who are you? They will Invite whomever they want
Where is murder fugitive dawood Ibrahim, theft fugitive vijay maliya, how could be 8 years prisoner committed in crime pregaya thagur  in your parliament she killed 35 people
If an Hindu poojari can attend an mall inauguration by Mr. Modi then why Dr. Nailk( I have no idea who this man is. ) should be kept out of Qatar ceremony. Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.
I support Zakir Naik Sahab because Nupur was not get jailed.
This is pure hate he left still they are after him because he knows their religion more themselves 
Third country who else can be PKMKB
This is another monster of the planet who thinks he can control the minds of his followers

Can’t digest it. Zakir naik is not a football fan. According to him football is haram . And he is a word to word follower of Islam. They way they said yes to beer and lgbtq before and imposed a ban just before two days it’s hard to believe whatever they r saying.
If india and Qatar relation gets worse it will never hurt qatar nobody need India Needs Qatar. Indian employees in qatar make so much money in Indian economy
P / p  ?
Dalit Naik sure but what about the 10000+ dead Indians and the thousands more trapped as indentured labourers. Maybe Modi should’ve talked them about that instead?
That dog should be haunted now.....
Whatever and however you fools do ..Allah will safeguard his servants
Who cares if Indians gonna boycott it. Football is not even considered a sports game in India, billions of people around to watch soccer even if Indians don't want to
Oil over game over then start grazing ships again
Boycott Qatar.
India will trap him very soom

Indian tourist wanted from India
Government of India is scared of Zakir Naik hehe Love you Dr.Zakir
Dr Zakir Naik is not a bigot. He’s a practicing Muslim. Who’s only purveying and propagating the beliefs that he is a trained master and as a torch bearer of his particular belief. Why are we going after him as an individual when the fact of the matter is he’s representing a mindset of over 2 billion people across the globe, therefore he is presenting his views which finds acceptance in a significant cross-section of the muslim population which has Islam as its state religion and knowing fully well that these are his views and these are this contributions to religions peace and harmony. The Arabs have chosen to welcome him to such a global event apart from the fact that it perhaps represents a resounding slap to the Indian state which threw respectable people like Nupur Sharma, A Raja under the bus without giving an opportunity to prove their position before the court of law. It’s for the Indian state to ask itself if they have the confidence to hold on their position and walk their talk to speak their mind. 
🤣
Lindus ki jali na.
Fear on the air.the nightmares is on the way......!
Why Qatar not deporting Zakir to India for trial.
India should severe all ties with Qatar.This is failure of Modi govt.
India must Boycott Qatar, put Qatar in fanatic list like  Pakistan, Turkey .
This is purely Modi channel
Hate speeches???
False information
jalte raho

The world terrorism was in one hand and the world want known who the country is. India is a Democratic country. Don't be force them to be a country like with "no Islamism ".
How funny is this hindustan times are in waiting list for and begging for write columns for Arabs leader and in India they published this because Indians need lies and masala

Ignore Qatar. Who are they? What are they? Let any Naik vaik kaik go die anywhere. Who cares as long as he's kept away from Indian shores. But one thing's sure, Naik will always miss India, the one country he's not allowed because like all muslims in India he knows India is best for all muslims.
They fear on  dr zakir naik 
The hate speeches against muslims are ok but Dr. Naik never gave any hate speech against the peaceful* hindu community. It's great lie to damage Dr. Naik's reputation. Only because Dr. Naik won't sing to modi's tune. The hindu extremist government led by modi also tried to convince Dr. Naik to come back to India and preach what modi says but he refused because he can't lie like feku.
Zakir is a to faced person. . He didn't even stood by what he said about football.
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...

Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰

Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles

Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness...

Now these days godi media has no news so

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind

Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..

Chaddis will say masterstroke but its Qatar the Baap Of masterstroke.  Invited but wouldnt accept it and wouldnt spoil bilateral Relation with India. 1 teer kahi NishaNe.. Wah Qatar Wah Mann gaye apko, Vishwa Guru ko Chunna Laga Diye.

If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.

Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.
All these Arabic countries are showing their might because of the oil reserves

Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!
So it.means it was an Indian propegenda & nothing....hahaha

Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!"

Like bruh get over with it. So what if qatar invited him? Doesnt means we should start fighting . Can't digest it , So don't watch it .Simple solution brothers.
He should be handed over to India.
Well Qatar should hand him over to India, not providing safe heaven. Other situations govt is apt to act why not this one. No lamé excuses

That man shouldn't be invited nomans events or otherwise..
Modi call Biden and say Zakir Naik Hellfire missile
Bycot fifa world cup
India should have boycotted FIFA.
Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart 
we proud of Dr Zakir naik
How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.
Why that make you jealous? Ask him  questions come right path  to peace.
Modi pls recall indian from g c c country possible or not

Those who saing shame on Qatar.....you people first say your govt to be in shame...why the people of other countries have to go to other countries and work for living...it means your govt failed to give employment...your govt can spend thousand thousand crores in election..but can't provide better living, better employment...shame on you people...who stays busy in finding others faults...instead of own fault.

What happened to Nupur Sharma case and another hate speech promoter of BJP officials 
First of all, why is Qatar playing aplogetic is out of my understanding. Qatar is the host and can invite anyone do its discretion. There are more hate speakers in India under the banner of Hinduvta and no action is taken against them
Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....
Who are you? They will Invite whomever they want
Where is murder fugitive dawood Ibrahim, theft fugitive vijay maliya, how could be 8 years prisoner committed in crime pregaya thagur  in your parliament she killed 35 people
If an Hindu poojari can attend an mall inauguration by Mr. Modi then why Dr. Nailk( I have no idea who this man is. ) should be kept out of Qatar ceremony. Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.
I support Zakir Naik Sahab because Nupur was not get jailed.
This is pure hate he left still they are after him because he knows their religion more themselves 
Third country who else can be PKMKB
This is another monster of the planet who thinks he can control the minds of his followers

Can’t digest it. Zakir naik is not a football fan. According to him football is haram . And he is a word to word follower of Islam. They way they said yes to beer and lgbtq before and imposed a ban just before two days it’s hard to believe whatever they r saying.
If india and Qatar relation gets worse it will never hurt qatar nobody need India Needs Qatar. Indian employees in qatar make so much money in Indian economy
P / p  ?
Dalit Naik sure but what about the 10000+ dead Indians and the thousands more trapped as indentured labourers. Maybe Modi should’ve talked them about that instead?
That dog should be haunted now.....
Whatever and however you fools do ..Allah will safeguard his servants
Who cares if Indians gonna boycott it. Football is not even considered a sports game in India, billions of people around to watch soccer even if Indians don't want to
Oil over game over then start grazing ships again
Boycott Qatar.
India will trap him very soom
Andha bhkatho Zakir naik ke paas jaho dum hai tho sawal karo Jo sach ka Sach pura batha tha hai

Indian tourist wanted from India
Government of India is scared of Zakir Naik hehe Love you Dr.Zakir
Dr Zakir Naik is not a bigot. He’s a practicing Muslim. Who’s only purveying and propagating the beliefs that he is a trained master and as a torch bearer of his particular belief. Why are we going after him as an individual when the fact of the matter is he’s representing a mindset of over 2 billion people across the globe, therefore he is presenting his views which finds acceptance in a significant cross-section of the muslim population which has Islam as its state religion and knowing fully well that these are his views and these are this contributions to religions peace and harmony. The Arabs have chosen to welcome him to such a global event apart from the fact that it perhaps represents a resounding slap to the Indian state which threw respectable people like Nupur Sharma, A Raja under the bus without giving an opportunity to prove their position before the court of law. It’s for the Indian state to ask itself if they have the confidence to hold on their position and walk their talk to speak their mind. 
🤣
Lindus ki jali na.
Fear on the air.the nightmares is on the way......!
Why Qatar not deporting Zakir to India for trial.
India should severe all ties with Qatar.This is failure of Modi govt.
India must Boycott Qatar, put Qatar in fanatic list like  Pakistan, Turkey .
This is purely Modi channel
Hate speeches???
False information
jalte raho
Zakir naik 
The world terrorism was in one hand and the world want known who the country is. India is a Democratic country. Don't be force them to be a country like with "no Islamism ".
How funny is this hindustan times are in waiting list for and begging for write columns for Arabs leader and in India they published this because Indians need lies and masala

Ignore Qatar. Who are they? What are they? Let any Naik vaik kaik go die anywhere. Who cares as long as he's kept away from Indian shores. But one thing's sure, Naik will always miss India, the one country he's not allowed because like all muslims in India he knows India is best for all muslims.
They fear on  dr zakir naik 
The hate speeches against muslims are ok but Dr. Naik never gave any hate speech against the peaceful* hindu community. It's great lie to damage Dr. Naik's reputation. Only because Dr. Naik won't sing to modi's tune. The hindu extremist government led by modi also tried to convince Dr. Naik to come back to India and preach what modi says but he refused because he can't lie like feku.
Zakir is a to faced person. . He didn't even stood by what he said about football.
While many pajeets are boycotting many hindus reverted to islam 
Its better to invite a 
Show the truth...mr zakir naik...he gave islamic dawah..HT much chk all his video footages...n then talk...he is citizen of India.. not terrorist
Zakir Naik zindabad
Zakir Naik.
Propagandists call him a terrorist! He is so much concerned about humans than these materialistic creatures who will do anything for their comfort

India should cut all relation with Qatar ,they must return all of their expatriate employees from Qatar.
Modi is the problem for all issues in India, he should have taken birth before independence and should have become the first PM, but he failed LOL
Hate speech should replaced by anti Hindu speeches
No need to apologise to hypocrites like modi
India is a 4th largest military power in the world. Why we cannot get back Sakeer Naik from Malaysia..?
Zakir Naik is best person stay blessed.
Qatar 🇶🇦
why should not you change your channel name to Modi Channel
Hypocricy of qatar
Joker nalayak is his real name  
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!

As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.

Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!

Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth

Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles

Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun

Now these days godi media has no news so

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.

Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...

If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.

Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!

Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!"

Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart

How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.
Why that make you jealous? Ask him  questions come right path  to peace.

Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....

Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.
I support Zakir Naik Sahab because Nupur was not get jailed.
This is pure hate he left still they are after him because he knows their religion more themselves

Ex muslim sahil YouTube channel dekhoon
Can’t digest it. Zakir naik is not a football fan. According to him football is haram . And he is a word to word follower of Islam. They way they said yes to beer and lgbtq before and imposed a ban just before two days it’s hard to believe whatever they r saying.
If india and Qatar relation gets worse it will never hurt qatar nobody need India Needs Qatar. Indian employees in qatar make so much money in Indian economy
P / p  ?
Dalit Naik sure but what about the 10000+ dead Indians and the thousands more trapped as indentured labourers. Maybe Modi should’ve talked them about that instead?
That dog should be haunted now.....
Whatever and however you fools do ..Allah will safeguard his servants
Who cares if Indians gonna boycott it. Football is not even considered a sports game in India, billions of people around to watch soccer even if Indians don't want to
Oil over game over then start grazing ships again
Boycott Qatar.
India will trap him very soom
Andha bhkatho Zakir naik ke paas jaho dum hai tho sawal karo Jo sach ka Sach pura batha tha hai
Football is not haram for islam
A country like a 
Qatar Jihadistan
If it was Israelis  they would  have kidnapped ...him bundeledup like Adof Aikeman in Argentina and packed him to Israel to stand trial. India's laws are very soft and not strict and hard...unfortunate.
We stand with China when it comes to India.
Indian tourist wanted from India
Government of India is scared of Zakir Naik hehe Love you Dr.Zakir
Dr Zakir Naik is not a bigot. He’s a practicing Muslim. Who’s only purveying and propagating the beliefs that he is a trained master and as a torch bearer of his particular belief. Why are we going after him as an individual when the fact of the matter is he’s representing a mindset of over 2 billion people across the globe, therefore he is presenting his views which finds acceptance in a significant cross-section of the muslim population which has Islam as its state religion and knowing fully well that these are his views and these are this contributions to religions peace and harmony. The Arabs have chosen to welcome him to such a global event apart from the fact that it perhaps represents a resounding slap to the Indian state which threw respectable people like Nupur Sharma, A Raja under the bus without giving an opportunity to prove their position before the court of law. It’s for the Indian state to ask itself if they have the confidence to hold on their position and walk their talk to speak their mind. 
🤣
Lindus ki jali na.
Fear on the air.the nightmares is on the way......!
Why Qatar not deporting Zakir to India for trial.
India should severe all ties with Qatar.This is failure of Modi govt.
India must Boycott Qatar, put Qatar in fanatic list like  Pakistan, Turkey .
This is purely Modi channel
Hate speeches???
False information
jalte raho
Zakir naik 
The world terrorism was in one hand and the world want known who the country is. India is a Democratic country. Don't be force them to be a country like with "no Islamism ".
How funny is this hindustan times are in waiting list for and begging for write columns for Arabs leader and in India they published this because Indians need lies and masala
FREE KASHMIR🇵🇰
Hopeless
Send him to Afghanistan
What about hate speeches of BJP politicians against muslims??  And crores spent in buying other party MP's ??
totally fake news 
cult of Allah...
It not new for Muslim world terrorists is also religion guru in Arab world
What about dirty baba of hate speeches?
Qatar is cunning
Sham India .
India mein gai mutur loog inpad jahil loog education is important I request all muslims educated banoo
Now endians with 2G internet will bycott FIFA WC
Indian rss sangaparivar terrors criticism
❤
Ignore Qatar. Who are they? What are they? Let any Naik vaik kaik go die anywhere. Who cares as long as he's kept away from Indian shores. But one thing's sure, Naik will always miss India, the one country he's not allowed because like all muslims in India he knows India is best for all muslims.
They fear on  dr zakir naik 
The hate speeches against muslims are ok but Dr. Naik never gave any hate speech against the peaceful* hindu community. It's great lie to damage Dr. Naik's reputation. Only because Dr. Naik won't sing to modi's tune. The hindu extremist government led by modi also tried to convince Dr. Naik to come back to India and preach what modi says but he refused because he can't lie like feku.
Zakir is a to faced person. . He didn't even stood by what he said about football.
While many pajeets are boycotting many hindus reverted to islam 
Its better to invite a 
Show the truth...mr zakir naik...he gave islamic dawah..HT much chk all his video footages...n then talk...he is citizen of India.. not terrorist
Zakir Naik zindabad
Zakir Naik.
Propagandists call him a terrorist! He is so much concerned about humans than these materialistic creatures who will do anything for their comfort
Lo bhi allah bhi football ko chapta karega
everyone learned should koran guide everyone..supported by koran,Hadith and other scholars who left islam muslim cult..reason for conversation into christianity..
Triggered lindus
FIFA is responsible 4 soccer being played on this evil Qatari regimes tainted abuse of human rights.
India should cut all relation with Qatar ,they must return all of their expatriate employees from Qatar.
Modi is the problem for all issues in India, he should have taken birth before independence and should have become the first PM, but he failed LOL
Hate speech should replaced by anti Hindu speeches
No need to apologise to hypocrites like modi
India is a 4th largest military power in the world. Why we cannot get back Sakeer Naik from Malaysia..?
Zakir Naik is best person stay blessed.
Qatar 🇶🇦
why should not you change your channel name to Modi Channel
Hypocricy of qatar
Joker nalayak is his real name  
Bak  Bak  karte raho. One speaks the truth  he  becomes fujitive  in india.
Very good acting by shahrukh khan
Indian hindus. Dont forget the army of imam mahdi when it comes. Dont think there is even a slim chance you can win by prosecuting the muslims.
I'm from India I respect zakir
It's haram because men and women mix together and watch . And women don't cover
Muslims are just 14 to 18 percent. Why is so much hate towards this minority. Can't we celebrate our differences and enjoy sports. 
Tum kitna bhi kuch keh lo...Islam ki dusmano...hum nehi manege
All AntiIndia person Motherland is Qatar.
Useless excuses by Qataris. Nab him and extradite if you are not involved officially.
Report the comment who is commenting to raise jihad against India.
God bliss Zakir  Naik
True sponser of radical islam Qatar
Muttu kodi kawadi hada…thoooooo
JEALOUS TINDU ALERT. Trolls paid by the 100 garbage cut/paste statements per roti have nothing to do but hung out on YT
India is always remained somewhat loose on terrorist Islamic agreesiveness,should expel Qatari  diplomats.
This is False information.. Dr.Zakir Naik loves India and Hindus ..
😂
Zakir Naik= Hindus Mom Crying LoL
Shut up andh bhakts
Zakir naik great
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰

Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.

Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.

Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar

Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???

Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun

Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.

Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?

Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.

May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik

Result nothing bro all gayan

Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!

Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India

Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart

How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.

Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....

Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.

Can’t digest it. Zakir naik is not a football fan. According to him football is haram . And he is a word to word follower of Islam. They way they said yes to beer and lgbtq before and imposed a ban just before two days it’s hard to believe whatever they r saying.
If india and Qatar relation gets worse it will never hurt qatar nobody need India Needs Qatar. Indian employees in qatar make so much money in Indian economy
P / p  ?
Dalit Naik sure but what about the 10000+ dead Indians and the thousands more trapped as indentured labourers. Maybe Modi should’ve talked them about that instead?
That dog should be haunted now.....

Government of India is scared of Zakir Naik hehe Love you Dr.Zakir
Dr Zakir Naik is not a bigot. He’s a practicing Muslim. Who’s only purveying and propagating the beliefs that he is a trained master and as a torch bearer of his particular belief. Why are we going after him as an individual when the fact of the matter is he’s representing a mindset of over 2 billion people across the globe, therefore he is presenting his views which finds acceptance in a significant cross-section of the muslim population which has Islam as its state religion and knowing fully well that these are his views and these are this contributions to religions peace and harmony. The Arabs have chosen to welcome him to such a global event apart from the fact that it perhaps represents a resounding slap to the Indian state which threw respectable people like Nupur Sharma, A Raja under the bus without giving an opportunity to prove their position before the court of law. It’s for the Indian state to ask itself if they have the confidence to hold on their position and walk their talk to speak their mind.

Ignore Qatar. Who are they? What are they? Let any Naik vaik kaik go die anywhere. Who cares as long as he's kept away from Indian shores. But one thing's sure, Naik will always miss India, the one country he's not allowed because like all muslims in India he knows India is best for all muslims.
They fear on  dr zakir naik 
The hate speeches against muslims are ok but Dr. Naik never gave any hate speech against the peaceful* hindu community. It's great lie to damage Dr. Naik's reputation. Only because Dr. Naik won't sing to modi's tune. The hindu extremist government led by modi also tried to convince Dr. Naik to come back to India and preach what modi says but he refused because he can't lie like feku.
Zakir is a to faced person. . He didn't even stood by what he said about football.
While many pajeets are boycotting many hindus reverted to islam 
Its better to invite a

everyone learned should koran guide everyone..supported by koran,Hadith and other scholars who left islam muslim cult..reason for conversation into christianity..
Triggered lindus
FIFA is responsible 4 soccer being played on this evil Qatari regimes tainted abuse of human rights.
India should cut all relation with Qatar ,they must return all of their expatriate employees from Qatar.
Modi is the problem for all issues in India, he should have taken birth before independence and should have become the first PM, but he failed LOL
Hate speech should replaced by anti Hindu speeches
No need to apologise to hypocrites like modi
India is a 4th largest military power in the world. Why we cannot get back Sakeer Naik from Malaysia..?
Zakir Naik is best person stay blessed.
Qatar 🇶🇦
why should not you change your channel name to Modi Channel
Hypocricy of qatar
Joker nalayak is his real name  
Bak  Bak  karte raho. One speaks the truth  he  becomes fujitive  in india.
Very good acting by shahrukh khan
Indian hindus. Dont forget the army of imam mahdi when it comes. Dont think there is even a slim chance you can win by prosecuting the muslims.
I'm from India I respect zakir
It's haram because men and women mix together and watch . And women don't cover
Muslims are just 14 to 18 percent. Why is so much hate towards this minority. Can't we celebrate our differences and enjoy sports. 
Tum kitna bhi kuch keh lo...Islam ki dusmano...hum nehi manege
All AntiIndia person Motherland is Qatar.
Useless excuses by Qataris. Nab him and extradite if you are not involved officially.
Report the comment who is commenting to raise jihad against India.
God bliss Zakir  Naik
True sponser of radical islam Qatar
Muttu kodi kawadi hada…thoooooo
JEALOUS TINDU ALERT. Trolls paid by the 100 garbage cut/paste statements per roti have nothing to do but hung out on YT
India is always remained somewhat loose on terrorist Islamic agreesiveness,should expel Qatari  diplomats.
This is False information.. Dr.Zakir Naik loves India and Hindus ..
😂
Zakir Naik= Hindus Mom Crying LoL
Shut up andh bhakts
Zakir naik great
Why did you put Modi's photo with King Tamim.modi is a Tea seller.
Great of greats Dr zakir naik is someone whom nobody can even challenge in his preachings. Many Hindus and Christians scholars tried and all failed. Simple is that when you can’t beat someone by your arguments than show your power which is useless in case of Dr zakir mail.. he’s a true believer and world knows how much competent and authentic he’s… so at the end Muslims are still alive even from last decades international media and other electronic media portraying them too negative.. so being a Muslim it’s duty to spread message of Islam even in any situation of life but peacefully. So if he’s addressing world peacefully what’s an issue. If you have any insecurities about your beliefs or you don’t wanna believe what he says. It’s your choice bro. So enjoy what you wanna enjoy. And let him preach may be many people wants to get benefit from his talk.. All Islamic world needs to set stage for Dr zakir naik especially. May Allah give us hidayat. Jazakallah
If this corrupted government have power then send Ajith Dobal to QATAR   and bring him back to India
QATAR less Muslims ? Why need him
Hate speech 
Only BJP
He is better than Modi
IndiA modi very bad
Qatar is hell
The football is not haram but you have to play under sharea law  and zakir naik come to qatar to deliver massege of thruth to the world .
Qatar should handover that's criminal to India ASAP.
Zakir naik stay blessed
Modi value only in Inida..
So Sad to see people these days don't even think or investigate before they judge someone...this guy has been cleared by courts of law...
Dr Zakir Naik Sahab Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad
Yeah and modi and his associates never spread hate speeches day and night.... report the truth please instead of fooling people
This so-called "preacher" was even expelled from Malasiya bcoz of preaching hatred against Malay Indians & Malay Chinese.Qatar must learn from Malasiya.
U can’t do anything thing hindus islam the fastest growing kis kis ki roko ge
Without voice this channel is very boring
Shame on you India for oppressing Muslims.
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement

It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar

Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar out here making history. First host to lose the first WC game 
We salute Dr .Zakir Naik.sir.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone

How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind

Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...

If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.
Qatar and All Muslims  in the world are same.....we all love islam... We are muslim

The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.

Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!

Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart

How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.

Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....

Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.
I support Zakir Naik Sahab because Nupur was not get jailed.

Can’t digest it. Zakir naik is not a football fan. According to him football is haram . And he is a word to word follower of Islam. They way they said yes to beer and lgbtq before and imposed a ban just before two days it’s hard to believe whatever they r saying.
If india and Qatar relation gets worse it will never hurt qatar nobody need India Needs Qatar. Indian employees in qatar make so much money in Indian economy
P / p  ?
Dalit Naik sure but what about the 10000+ dead Indians and the thousands more trapped as indentured labourers. Maybe Modi should’ve talked them about that instead?

Government of India is scared of Zakir Naik hehe Love you Dr.Zakir
Dr Zakir Naik is not a bigot. He’s a practicing Muslim. Who’s only purveying and propagating the beliefs that he is a trained master and as a torch bearer of his particular belief. Why are we going after him as an individual when the fact of the matter is he’s representing a mindset of over 2 billion people across the globe, therefore he is presenting his views which finds acceptance in a significant cross-section of the muslim population which has Islam as its state religion and knowing fully well that these are his views and these are this contributions to religions peace and harmony. The Arabs have chosen to welcome him to such a global event apart from the fact that it perhaps represents a resounding slap to the Indian state which threw respectable people like Nupur Sharma, A Raja under the bus without giving an opportunity to prove their position before the court of law. It’s for the Indian state to ask itself if they have the confidence to hold on their position and walk their talk to speak their mind.

Ignore Qatar. Who are they? What are they? Let any Naik vaik kaik go die anywhere. Who cares as long as he's kept away from Indian shores. But one thing's sure, Naik will always miss India, the one country he's not allowed because like all muslims in India he knows India is best for all muslims.
They fear on  dr zakir naik 
The hate speeches against muslims are ok but Dr. Naik never gave any hate speech against the peaceful* hindu community. It's great lie to damage Dr. Naik's reputation. Only because Dr. Naik won't sing to modi's tune. The hindu extremist government led by modi also tried to convince Dr. Naik to come back to India and preach what modi says but he refused because he can't lie like feku.
Zakir is a to faced person. . He didn't even stood by what he said about football.
While many pajeets are boycotting many hindus reverted to islam 
Its better to invite a

😂
Zakir Naik= Hindus Mom Crying LoL
Shut up andh bhakts
Zakir naik great
Why did you put Modi's photo with King Tamim.modi is a Tea seller.
Great of greats Dr zakir naik is someone whom nobody can even challenge in his preachings. Many Hindus and Christians scholars tried and all failed. Simple is that when you can’t beat someone by your arguments than show your power which is useless in case of Dr zakir mail.. he’s a true believer and world knows how much competent and authentic he’s… so at the end Muslims are still alive even from last decades international media and other electronic media portraying them too negative.. so being a Muslim it’s duty to spread message of Islam even in any situation of life but peacefully. So if he’s addressing world peacefully what’s an issue. If you have any insecurities about your beliefs or you don’t wanna believe what he says. It’s your choice bro. So enjoy what you wanna enjoy. And let him preach may be many people wants to get benefit from his talk.. All Islamic world needs to set stage for Dr zakir naik especially. May Allah give us hidayat. Jazakallah
If this corrupted government have power then send Ajith Dobal to QATAR   and bring him back to India
QATAR less Muslims ? Why need him
Hate speech 
Only BJP
He is better than Modi
IndiA modi very bad
Qatar is hell
The football is not haram but you have to play under sharea law  and zakir naik come to qatar to deliver massege of thruth to the world .
Qatar should handover that's criminal to India ASAP.
Zakir naik stay blessed
Modi value only in Inida..
So Sad to see people these days don't even think or investigate before they judge someone...this guy has been cleared by courts of law...
Dr Zakir Naik Sahab Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad Zindabad
Yeah and modi and his associates never spread hate speeches day and night.... report the truth please instead of fooling people
This so-called "preacher" was even expelled from Malasiya bcoz of preaching hatred against Malay Indians & Malay Chinese.Qatar must learn from Malasiya.
U can’t do anything thing hindus islam the fastest growing kis kis ki roko ge
Without voice this channel is very boring
Shame on you India for oppressing Muslims.
Islamophobia! Islamophobia! Islamophobia! Nothing else in this video.
He needs to be extradited to India and tried for hate speeches. A fake preaches who is good with words and uses religion as an excuse.
Center of terro funding
❤
Vahabi vahabi vahabi
Qatar is Muslim. Pakistan is Muslim. Malaysia is Muslim. I don't know why indians are so confused. Long live Qatar
Love zakir naik from India and hate modi 
fugitive media Hindustan times.
Qatar should have ignored India and not responded to them... 
Zakir Naik
I said shut up
Zakir nalayak
Long Live our Mujahid Dr Zakir Naik 
Massive furious by whom? 
Since when do Muslims cave in to trumped up charges made by idolators?
Lol what hate speech? Proving that youreligion is a joke?
Its a high time God should give the Muslims the khilafa back. The Islamic Republic State would shut all these stupid politics down against Muslims.
👎
Dr Zakir Naik peace be upon him is the pride of Muslims, he is our proud
👎
May Allah protect you in such a way that even a sneeze does not hurt you. Love you so much as a muslim brother 
I have watched many of Dr Naik's lectures but have never come across any form of hate as alleged. In fact he talks about commonalty of Scriptures as grounds for promoting unity among people. Any normal or sane-minded  person would dismiss these charges as false. It is obvious that those who fear unity are behind this tirade.
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
They banned him from preaching to the world. So God brought the world to him
More than 2000 Nepalese labourers died in this project. Many more became handicapped. Shame on Qatar Government and FIFA ! Victims and their families must be compensated enough.
Good news
What ever india or any other power want to break the islamic preachers such a great precher like zakir naik they will never ever stop them cause Allah is with us and the truth will remain truth ever inshallah
Hatsoff and respect for Qatar 
May Allah protect him.
Brother asked a very good question
Great person.
Respect China increasing...
Qatar is less biliveable in anything it says. It will be near impossible that Qatar's foreign office did not know to whom visa were issued.
Zakir naik is a great  legend
In an insult to the Messenger, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, in the series “The Ottomans”, which were made by Netflix in the Hindi dubbing, which came down a while ago, the last episode or the one before it, when the Sultan talks about the hadith of conquering constantinople instead of saying prophet said to us he says the priest told us, we should not be silent about this.
Let's wait for our external affairs ministry's statement. I am an Indian, need to know our ministry stand.
Qatar’s anti Indian tilt has been observed on many occasions and the fact that Pakistan military has boots on the ground and Zakir Naik has been invited are clear indicators of the nexus of Qatar, Pakistan and Malaysia in provoking and insulting India. There is bound to be many more embarrassing faux pas that are going to emerge that would harass players, visitors and spectators alike. FIFA will think twice in conducting football tournaments in the middle east ever again. When faith clashes with sports freedom a showdown is, inevitably, on the cards.
Peaceful community spreading peace
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Am always happy working with acclaimbanking they keep putting a smile on my face I appreciate you so much guys
Zakir Naik
Whether he was being extended an invitation, or being intimated by mediators  or he went there out of his volition; ultimately, he has successfully fulfilled his agenda of spreading the seed of pestilence that which is called Zeehad.
The most irritating thing about this channel is that even though i am watching a video, i need to read out the news....
I watched it 2x speed just to read the news.
Qatar has made mockery of India. This is response for the irresponsible action India took on MS Nupur for objections raised by Qatar. And now in another snub to India it says Zakir was not officially called. Thank God it was not Mohd Azar or Hafiz from Pakistan. Answer would be the same.
Hope Qatar is true... India has found its true power in world diplomacy 
HE IS FREE TO VISIT AT WILL 
After investing money into FIFA Germany has called for boycott , the FIFA will happen irrespective of what countries decide cause ruling factor is money
Brother,sister asked good question,,
Hats off to Qatar🫡
There's a basic question :
Huge respect to our Muslim 
Well done qatar for inviting dr naik , I have seen many videos where so many Hindu’s have reverted to Islam , that’s the reason india has issues with dr naik .. he has committed no illegal acts in India
I really like his speeches. The more I watch them the more I like Hinduism.
Wow Great man Dr zakir naik
The guilty one always runs away and looks for others to protect
The one who does not listen does not understand is inflexible on their civilisational issues ultimately writes history. Be proudly intolerant strong heavily armed. Always remember previously also  courts have given verdicts regardimg Sanatani matters not based on correctness of cause or laws to preserve "PEACE IN THE COUNTRY". Raise your voice be proud and loud in every media be intolerant and aggressive.
impressive, qatar is probably the 1st nation that is not bothered by aggressiveness of modi govt. it's impressive to see someone has balls while entire us and europe bent knees to our modi ji, maybe qatar could be a good ally to India, as strong supports strong 🇮🇳
GOOD JOB QATAR
Doing well my brother 
Everyone understands after 60 year's
What is meaning of not formal invitation not given , he did very thing that is came for
If what Qatar is saying then Qatar must send Zakir Naik back to India as soon as he reaches Qatar.
Qatar is the Best country to ever host a Wonderful World Cup and it's right in all the decisions and messures it took.
I knew today that Zaikr Naik was born in India.
Zakir Naik is the world class Muslim scholar and a great Hero in the world. 
I'm stand with Dr Zakir Naik.
Qatar: No we didn't invite Zakir
Qatar 2 goals, India nil.
A huge respect for Dr. Zakir Naik, May Allah swt bless and protects him always. أمين
Power move by Qatar 
What more can be expected from a nation that funds al jazeera , a nation that purposefully "finds" problems in others countries' society but never talk about its very own dire existential issue
Enemies of Islam always try to stop Islamic dawah but they failed failed 
Hardly an explanation ! 
God bless India 🇮🇳 
No matter what you say this guy is intelligent and influential. Whether good or bad . Every influential person has something different from the rest.
Dr Zakir Naik will be protected in this Universe forever
Big Salute for Our Nation, Jaihind 
ماشاء الله تبارك الله
Though it could be taqqiya reply, but atleast subcontinent Abdools got to know who is the Baba from this reply.
India must investigate first on its  own political leaders who are involved in a lot of controversies and subtle terrorist acts
Is Qatar suggesting that Mr. Zakir will be illegally entering Doha? In that case Doha and Qatar can do the needful. Also they can also arrest him for India.
☝
If he was not formally invited, how was he allowed as a guest in the opening ceremony? If I'm not a member of Argentina, can I still come and play with Messi without consequences?
Asif we care or give a toss what Indian officials think well done 🇶🇦Qatar
I’m a medical doctor 
what a Lion man !! the biggest fear of hindutva because if he talk, he convince them.May Allah protect him from evils eye.
During Nupur Sharma incident, Qatar called our diplomat and questioned him even though her statements were not official version. Why didn’t we called Qatar’s ambassador and asked Qatar to handover this jehadi to us?
One Ummah
Love or hate China but only that country handles this peaceful community very well. Good job China 
Dr zakir will prevail 
What a reason. Waah
Islam will reach to every door in the world, Zakir nike is the best Islami preacher in this current Era, so you can ask every type of Question from him or from me also INSHAALLAH
May ALLAH bless Jakir Naik long and Healthy life...
W Naik. 
Respect for Qatar went up
Have guts bring Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi nirva modi and others who left India by default Billions $$$$ ...
God bless
Pointing hate speeches just one sided is a huge mistake! If religious speeches are hate speeches, then what is not hate speech! Why should BJP not stop its propaganda campaign against Islam and Muslims in India? I’m afraid India has less freedom of speech and expression, especially religious freedom!
May Almighty Allah protect zakir naik from evil eye of enemies of Islam and enemies of peace zakir naik is a ambassador of peace.
1400 years ago, there were no Football
RAW secret operation against fugitive will be welcome and appreciated !
Super Qatar
If it was not an official invitation then why the hell He was doing in the VVIP box and welcomed as among chief guest in the FIFA events? They are trying fooling us again. Shame on FIFA.
Us and many western countries has say this one of best world cups in world
A great scholar
🙏
Let's just say that Qatar trying to reach out to the Indian government on the issue of Zakir Naik doesn't concern the government anymore. As he's a declared fugitive by our judiciary and he's no more welcome in India.
Qatar 
Indian muslims be like why you qatar surrendered to Hindu modi
Very straightforward men ever may Allah protect him from all enemies
Surat No 61 : سورة الصف - Ayat No 8 
Respect to Qatar 
We always love and appreciate Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah Almighty protect him always like the way he has protected him from Modi. We pray for his success and good health.
History has proven and proves it again and again that the more successful you get the more hate you get
Don't worry Raw will take care of him...
What Zakir Naik is doing is to spread the word of Allah and His Messenger, i order to reach people you have to be among them, world cup in Qatar its a good opportunity to reach people for Zakir Naik and many others, and who is Modi to say whom they can or cannot invide to their own country.
India must have asked Qatar to arrest Naik and deport him to India to face charges
Alhumdulillah more than 500 people accepted Islam on the very first day
Bcoz many Hindus reverted to Islam
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar:
ICC needs to invite nupur as chief guest.
Very good man .may Allah bless him and give hidaya for his enemies
If no invitation was given thn how he reached on the FIFA platform ...qatar has no shame ....
Indian govt now should summon the chief of Qatar embassy in India and issue show cause notice and should also warn against the consequences
I stand with qatar 
Qatar must take action as they did in Nupur sharma case..
This is the first time that FIFA world cup is being discussed more for it's controversies rather than the game itself.... From now onwards FIFA will think 100 time to select a middle east country or islamic country for world cup... Radhe Radhe
This is the blame for him he is the true gem for our generation he doesn't speak bad about any religion if it is that means there is bad in your scriptures coz he always quote the references with chapter number verse number don't talk bad about him first watch his lectures
Qatar
India must ask Qatar to hand over Zakir Naik. It must be easy since Doha claims that he has not been invited by the official authorities. If Doha is so concerned about Bi-Lateral relations then it must cater to New Delhi's request. Else Doha will always remember to treat New Delhi as inferior, it would set a precedent.
qatar to India 
Allah gives respect to who he wants. May Allah keep him protected against all Zionists and hinduvtas that have done mass false propaganda against him.
NUPUR SHARMA SHOULD BE GIVEN A HIGH RANKING TITLE IN INDIA. AS BRAVE HEART LADY OF INDIA.
Without official information how did he get the visa or get inside
Bottom line. India is growing strong. That rich countries are justifying there acts...
We can do similar things in future, they will not be able to do anything.
When they have to chose between a person and a whole country. You know drill.
This man is a living super computer 
India should also likewise clarify its stand vis-a-vis supporting Israel on the infringements of human rights violations on Palestinian statehood issue.  What HT? Jai Hind.
Since gulf states like Qatar share v cordial ties with India they r right that third party countries could b tryn to creat mischief but what they can do is apprehend the fugitive n hand him over to India. That simple. Friendly countries must cooperate with one another when it comes to crooks n criminals.
The more i see his face and hateful speeches, more i grow love towards Hinduism
Big salute to Indian govt.
We love our Islamic preacher Mr, Zakir Naik sahab, good job keep it up
Well, an informally issued formal invitation. Brilliant "Qatanalysis".
Whatever ZN does there directly or indirectly, he will not get even 0.72 , forget 72 !
Qatar’s invitation of Dr Zakir naik was the perfect slap in the face of India’s Hindu nationalist BJP government that encouraged its spokesperson Nupur Sharma 3 times to go on national Tv to make insulting remarks about Islamic faith!!
If he wasn't invited, then please your highness of Qatar, handover Zakir Naik to Indian Government 
Forgot zakir what about 8 Indian spy's
God bless Qatar....one of few Muslim country with balls...never bowing down to foreign orders
Qatar zindabad
" So called Peaceful community was not officially invited "
Qatar should be punished with sanctions  immediately and India should forget this insult and break all its ties with Qatar as it did with Pakistan.
If India did not issue a red corner notice or extradite him from Malaysia, who do you think is to blame?
Goat lover
If India done he reply it is internal matter
This should have taken 20 seconds to say! It's like watching daily soap in ZeeTV
The way Zakir roared on the mike... I thought he was real. Then I heard he jumped out of the country leaving all his followers here.
Dr Zakir Naik ( born after centuries ) is a gift of Allah to the muslims of digital age who were unable to defend their religion on scientific and logical Grounds
FIFA world cup got too secular for me :)
All gulf countries want India for survive.  That's why gulf countries are rushing for FTA deal with India. 
So many qualified people in the chat.. I don't even know english
Be heavily armed and organised in your areas using local clubs and puja committees and organizing bi weekly or weekly temple gatherings. Keep nearby Hindu Sangathan Number handy. You guys will be able to protect yourself better against organised violence. Always keep good intelligence by doing sampoorn bahiskaar of them. 
Qatar must invite Zakir Naik again for the Final Soccer game and BJP RSS will flourish in hate.
Inshallah
Zakir should face the laws in his country. Don't worry Allah will protect you for the work you have done. Have faith, ok?
While many pajeets are boycotting, many hindus are reverting to islam in qatar 
Bharat Mata Ki Jai
Modi govt approached dr zakir naik (h a) thrice to gain support for CAA and abrogation of Article 370 and in return his govt was ready to reinstate his ngo, unfreeze his assets, and withdraw investigations and FIRs but he patently refused.
We always love and respect Dr.Zakir nayak
Welp...it would be an act of foolishness if someone Questions Muslim country about inviting a Islamic scholar..that was a  befitting reply given by Qatar..they kept on mind the relationship between two countries otherwise they could have replied saying mind ur own business 
Even I there is no official invitation to Naik,he is among the respected figure in Islamic world,whom needs no invitation in where there is Islam.
Recently Qatar kicks to indian agenda zakir was there in opening ceremony and insha'Allah soon will be inviting in fifa matches your indian worker working in qatar you depends on qatar so how can you ask or dictate some one to do this or that
Baap se dar gya qatar
പഴയ ഇന്ത്യയല്ല... ഇത് നരേന്ദ്രൻ ഭരിക്കുന്ന പുതിയ ഇന്ത്യ... ഓർത്ത് കളിച്ചോ സുഡാപ്പികളെ... 
Because Muslim world honors Zakir Naik
Why they’re afraid of him so much 
My Question:
Senseless to criticize the knowledge of Zakir Naik. Better VHP send any single Hindu Scholar to debate Zakir and relay the outcome of discussion world over.
Here some radicals are commenting like india is poor loll, it's 2022 come to reality u can't describe india by some poor indian states fate. I am from Karnataka my state GDP is 274billion USD and with 6.2 crore population 5.5  crore are kannadigas rest of them are belongs to other states. Like Karnataka we also have states like TN, Maharashtra, gujurat. These four states GDP is higher than whole Arab countries GDP. And  in 2050 whole world will witness which country will rule the world. After getting looted nearly 44trillion USD still we managed to appear as 5th largest economy within 75yrs of independence. I am not defaming whole Arab countries but when comes to reality if whole world goes green energy what will be the fate of Arab countries Which are majorly depending on petroleum products.
👏
I urge everyone to look up Zakir Naik and his outrageous statements about non-Muslims, terrorism and woman hood. Disappointing to see Qatar to try legitimize Taliban as Afghan government without any proper election and now Zakir Naik  … well thank you FIFA, football clubs and celebrity football player moralists, sponsors and cooperating brands … this will be remembered.
May allah bless you sir Dr Zakir Naik
A great scholar 
I love dr zakir naik iam from Ethiopia
Good.
INDIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, GREAT JOB MODI...
I support Xakir naik ,
MashaAllah TabarakAllah AllahuAkbar
We would love to see him giving lecture from Ayodhya, parliament of india, Red fort. 
govt babuon  mey  dum nahi hain qatar ki hypocrisy aur akkad kokaisey thick karey. Jab Nupur sharma case (which is our internal matter ) main qatar objection uthayey to hamari sarkar ghutney pey aa gayi thi aur Nupur ko suspend kiya tha even though she said nothing bad.
This is hypocrisy . Zakir Naik publicly said that playing football on a professional level is also haram then why is he being invited 
Hats off Respected Dr. Zakir Naik
Modi should now bring back Nupur Sharma and give her the best cabinet membership.
Zakir nayek jindabad amazing Allah protected him Amin 
Qatar is under no obligation to explain Dr Zaik's visit . Dr Zakir went home, Qatar is a muslim nation. India rejected one of its best because of RSS
I'm follower of zakir naik.. indian never produced any evidence reagrding zakir naik.. he is preacher but india (modi govt) intentionaly defaming him..I'm from india.. I had huge respect for zakir naik.
Am proud of qatar 🇶🇦 
More countries need to do what Qatar 🇶🇦 is doing and invite Zakir Naik to spread the message of Peace.
Shame on those who celebrate an event that caused death of thousands , whose families will never received any apologies or compensation for their untimely deaths caused due to callous negligence and lack of any human rights. SHAME!
Qatar should inform India that was an honor Hosting Dr. Zakir at the VIP
🎉
if I was Qatar Imaam, I would tell India not meddle in our internal affairs & also add Zakir Naik is our crown jewels regarding our Islamic teachers ..
SO HOW WAS Z.NAIK WALKING THE RED CARPET
When Zakir was at India Govt should have acted more promptly, That man should have been behind bars just like Ram Rahim.
What you people have been saying have nothing to do with reality and facts.He is a man of Peace and Love.We, all know,all media whether it is of local level or international,it is funded.
Dr zakir naik was a great person who  wanted us to learn what our religion tells and see it with our own eyes so that we can't be fooled. Today india's  main issue is religion based politics and we easily get trapped into these issues
Qatar government jindabad
No doubt zakir Naik is a great scholar.
I am with Dr.Zakir naek
This is first and last time Quatar hosting such an event
I LOVE DR ZAKIR NAIK - ISLAM & HINDUISM LECTURE IS AMAZING
We love Dr. Zakir Naik for the sake of Almighty Allah! He is really a great servent of Islam.
No one is forced to attend the question and answer session if they will they can so don't blame like that
India should be proud to have scholars of this calibre who are world renowned. If our government has forced him to leave the country but he is still a hero in the hearts of millions of people
They are united on religious grounds,, they don't care shit about what india thinks.. hypocrisy ka seema nahi he
Indian should boycott this world cup if islamic nation talking about human rights in Kashmir openly then why we not raise this issue and also in Nupur Shama controversy how Qatar responded with all know so it's our time to counter them.
We're proud of Zakir Naik. He's the angel of peace 
What has Mr Naik done to upset the Indian government ? Is it that he debates and is a brilliant debater and India does not have the same calibre Hindu apologists? He is an academic, I do t understand why the Indian Hindu community is so so upset and calling him a fugitive etc ?
Dr. Joker Naik deceptively claims that his prophet is predicted in every religion's scriptures which is very true! But he distorts others scriptures to fit his prophet into their narratives in a positive manner! He fails to tell you the truth:-
Indien
The fugitive should be brought to justice.
True religion never destroy anyone
AYESHA KI SOFTWARE MEIN LUKAKU KI HARDWARE  ...
How can a single man can become a country national issue
God bless Dr. Zahir.. and May Allah protect Zahir Naik from all evils Ameen Summa Ameen..!!
🤣
Points Qatar is being criticized for -
As an Indian I know it yaha ka log kitna gawar or jahil ha bas dosro ko nicha dekhainga unki nazar sab bewakoof or khud bhot smart ha had hoti ha kise bhi chez or kouna giraga ya godi media
Dr zakir naik arrived in qatar but godi media has problem with it
We will make Nupur sharma a state guest whenever we will host worldcup
Dr Nayak is a pride of  India he is representing India in Qatar during Worldcup.
My enemy is your friend,then one day your enemy will  be my best friend,...
Dr.Zakir Naik has done great job for spreading the word of God and Islam. 
Humanity is a disgrace
India is afraid of one man 
Dr Jakir Nayek is a surprise for not only India but also whole the world 
Salute to Zakir sb....India is worry , he is spread the light....Still a lot of non believers are converting to Islam....Ma Sha Allah
Informally invited a formally wanted fugitive.
We the Ummah of 2.2 billions should not embolden the fascist hindutvas with any courtesy of a reply.
Great Dr naik. Truthful.. prove it where his speech is haterate.. people asks questions he replies
How Qatar grant Visa to Zak ?
Lots of love to Qatar from india 🇮🇳
There was a time that HT was a reliable source but unfroturnely it has been deduced to being mouth piece of Modi's Fanatic regime. 
The "virus" fled to Malaysia just before the NIA started it's enquiry. What does it mean 
The true muslim warrior. May Allah bless him.
Tamim bin Hamad
Shame on converted Indian Abdula support Haaram baap Qater
Zakir naik is the best preacher ever. Indian govt hate him because he was able to convince many Hindu Christians on Islam and thousands have converted . Those who are not biased can watch his videos.  He is not hate preacher.  There are many Indians Hindu  living in the rich Arab countries but at the same time dislike Muslims.
Im American 🇺🇸 but I love 
Remarks: poori duniya chalti hai
The world is watching what Qatar is doing in the name of football.  The world has seen why the GCC countries have isolated Qatar.  The world knows that Qatar has financed and facilitated terrorist attacks in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  Qatar has funded terrorist activities all over the world. It is not possible for Qatar to wash away the blood of those innocent people with this football festival. Jai hind 🇮🇳
Better call back our ambassador
Till now religion is used in politics now in sports sad state of affairs
I love Dr Zakir Naik. May Allah (S.W.T) bless him. <3
Failure of Indian intelligence agencies to prevent him from escaping to Malaysia  and the diplomatic failure in getting him extradited to india subsequently.Resultantly, he is preaching hatred in Quatar on this momentus FIFA occasion. Unfortunate.
No matters..hate will continue
India need to continue to stand strong in face of the Muslim world. No compromise .
He didn't cam media dilited mind and hate
I didn't expect anything different from Qatar
India should take strict actions of Malaysia and Qatar.. show its power to the world
Qatar will be punished if it interferes in our internal affairs further.
Qatar gives a damn 
Proud of Zakir Naik.
He should not have run and faced the Indian Law. Unless, of course, he knew.
🇮🇳
As an outside  Muslim who love and respect India. With all due respect, India can’t do anything and shouldn’t do anything. 
From where do you think Zakir Nalayak getting his funds from? One is a terror financier and other one is a terror preacher. Birds of a feather flock together 
😂
the best son india ever produced. Zakir is more valuable than Rama, lord Ganesha and other fairy tale gods and goddess.
The Indian government has no shame 
Indian muslims crying in corner
Girija tikko and Draupati 
I think that India should be proud to have someone that is Brilliant and Genius person such as Dr Zakir Naik. May God alone 'Allah' pleased him.
😂
Hindus need to show tolerance and respect. You can't call Muslims intolerant and then behave intolerant yourselves . Qatar is not India,  and will do what is best for it's country. India needs to respect this.
We all know what Qatar did during Nupur Sharma controversy. They were at the forefront.
Viva Zakir Naik!! welcome to Qatar and any other part of the world!!
Love Zakir for defending Islam.  Love Qatar.  As for India they should learn to love women not kill them at birth.  That’s why Islam came to stop such atrocities.
HANDS OFF DR Z NAIK  HE IS DOING A STERLING JOB  ITS OBVIOUS  THAT HINDUS  WILL HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HIM MAY ALLAH AZZAWAJAL PROTECT DR Z NAIK   ALWAYS AMEEN ALLAHUMA AMEEN YA RABB
What suits you you make that news,weather that exists or not
The greatest man on earth. India is lucky for Dr. Jakir Naik.
Then Qatar must deporte him and ask not be present till completion of events 
Beta baap se Darr gya
This is the best fifa ever
We love you Zakir Nayk...May Allah keep Qatar and Zakir Nayek blessed....this indian failed gov is trying so hard to make noise but onoy fails.
Habibi Tumhari ladki de do Jaakir bhai ko Subhanallah
A single lion to whom no Hindu can stand still. he is still snatching thousands of hindus to become muslims every single day.  read and become aware ghat everyday people converts to Islam Alhamdulillah
Private individual visits 'No government will advertise in public' but in dynastic and religious monarch rule it will do anything and money power' and Qatar is a country that acts alone in all matters.
May Allah keep dr Zakir nake safe 
Some people are mocking Dr Zakir Nayak 
Is there any place in the world left? Where this peaceful rama rama community doesn’t constantly cry lol
Jai shri ram
Zakir nayak is a pride of Muslims. Great gentleman and man of truth. Those who follow the demigods hate him because they are evildoers in the sight of true God.
IT IS A BLASH TO INDIAN ADMINISTRATION.
Barrister Cut With Ideology Spreading Barbarism 
In shaa Allah... allah will protect him and make him victorious over the disbelievers!
PAKISTANI ARE REAL FATHER OF HINDUS 🇵🇰
What about our naval officers?
Hats off Qatar..!!
Not possible without Qatar Govt's help!
Birds of same feathers flock together, this is it all about
Remember .Remember and bide your time .
Our Govt didnt catch him when he was in India  even if there was  serious charges .Now he running around the world and GoI cant do anything.
Respect china, Isreal, Burma
Indian Muslim who told this proud movement
zakir naik, love and respect from kerala
Thank you Qatar
🇮🇳🇶🇦
Good
Nupur Sharma for ICC event I guess 
Well done govt
Qatar be like:
Kattar or Katora mulk, Abdools are same everywhere...
Sir Jayshanker G Ko Iske Bare Mein Bolne Ko Diya Jaye
He is 
It's thier internal matter. We should not interfere
Indian Muslims having a meltdown 
Modi bhai to to khatarnak nikla
Truth can be silenced but never destroyed, May Xakir Naik enlighten and guide as many Brmins and bring them under the truth of of Islam.
Why does the title and everywhere else it's mentioned Modi govt? It's India's elected government. Why name a person or party in such situations?
It's so very nice of Qatar allowing Dr. Zakir Naik to visit their country.
Mansha Allah proud of my brothers to invite their brother zakir . Love bro zakir for his work keep going brother and spread the truth
Remember all those 2000 Nepalese who died building the stadium.
Drzakirnaikegood
😂
Naik
Birds of feathers flock togather.
Who cares India can do what they like!! May Allah swt protect dr zakir naik ameen.
This is tide slap on bjp govt ...
Qatar is getting to far away by pinching India time to time but remember India never forgets it friends & foes.
Modi ha to mumkin ha 
He's not officially invited, so he jumped out of nowhere on the biggest ceremony event in Qatar 
Narendra Modi
Zakir Nike is our hero.
Love from Egypt 🇪🇬 
Now, we have no right to ask our government as to why they don't take up the matter with Qatari government.  So,no responsibility of government. Everything is fine.
Qatar is the Best
Indian government couldn't stop his preaching and words so they had to boycott him. I'm sure both of the allegations made by India are a reason to make him a migrant from India. Can't beat them with words and intellect then use dirty politics to humiliate him. It's ok though Allah makes ways for those who are on the truth.
Dr:zakir naik great leader
Why not his sponsor papers be put on public domain by quatar govt is straight forward.  Why to give reply only. Our local TV channels should insist or find out - will it take 3-4-5-6 days to find?
Ek Islamic nation se hum aur Kya expect Kar sakte he
Without lies Islam and islamic nation would have died now
Qatar is this thinking that we Indians are fools. Can anyone come for opening ceremony to such international event and moreover he does opening by reading some notes in Arabic and Qatar says he came on his own. Abe kis ko uloo banero ho. So let the interpol interfere and send him to India. Can Qatar take this responsibility. Let the EAM look in to this issue. Jai Hind 🇮🇳 🇮🇳
India would be there in next Football worldcup. For sure.
Even UAE banned him entering into country and banned his peace tv channel.
God bless Qatar and Dr Zakir Naik.

Something fishy about naik leaving India just before charges ,that too in modi govt
These were the same people who criticise Nupur Sharma
Then how did he go into the VIP box. ???
Private visit to Doha, can India extradict him???
Looks like all HT news anchors have died considering only loud music with subtitles
Ye Darr achha laga
Thinking like big brother.  But millions bringing bread and butter from that independent nation
dr jakir naik is great man respect  
Why they are scared of zakir naik 
Burnol lagane ka
Modiji did not concentrated on qatar 
And India under pressure of Arabs especially Qatar suspended Nupur Sharma while she was only reacting and they have the audacity to call someone who publically shames Hinduism , converts and  allegedly involved in provoking some riots.
INDIAN DELEGATE IS NO IMPORTANT THAN DR ZAKIR NAIK.
Indian government has lost reputation in human rights issues. Fabricated cases against naik cannot stop others from hosting him
If my good friend invites my enemy to his home knowingly that his my enemy probably we can't be friends in near future as simple as that, 
Godi to Ameri Qatar on telephone 
Its just  a shield of lies or takiya..... Let him have some halal fun
Come on qatar, keep them in darkness... 
Let him check  !
Double standards by Qatar..
I thought we were free .
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Qatar is a sovereign country and it can host anyone
Indian Media 
How can FIFA choose Qatar as a Foot ball world cup spot???
Now these days godi media has no news so 
We support Qatar Airways
Jalo bhakto jalo 
Whether you like it or not zakir naik is not a fugitive and has never been a fugitive,Qatar is islamic nation and if he is being called there to preach, it doesn't concerns anyone of us so lets  tak it easy 
Bhaisb bnda Qatar me h aur khujli logo ko India me horhi hai
Shallow mind is wat am seeing,I know I understand most of dajjal followers don't like zakir naik when he revert people to islam after seeing the truth but its OK,in islam we don't force people to join its ur choice n its Allah who guide whoever he want so its up to wat you think is right with you or not
this demon is creating trouble where ever he goes
in... ka  insult 
We need to become more powerful to ignore these nations.
खुजली बढ़ गई है।
Dr zakir naik is the most knowlegable preacher in this world,also he is not a preacher for closed mind,blind people,but he is preacher for only the open minded community who want to see what is behind the wall,open minded people from different religion are admitting him,so you closed mind people you either shut your mouth or try to open your mind to the reality and reasons.
Russia for for the Ukraine But Friend for India...so don't go to such international politics it's above your mind

New foot ball coach has emerged Representing Dhoha for additional funds...

Zakir naik is absolutely one the best man no matter how much Lundbhakt (ashrami rapist culture) community maline his image, India is with you. Stay strong zakir naik..
Is India playing at the world cup 2022?
Hypocrisy of Qatar knows
People like nirave modi and vijay malai are happily living with money of people no one questions because there are not muslims . There are not fugitive , not looters and not misleaders  . When we question  something don’t believe the media search about a person then rise the question , why ? This happens . In india media is gone never ever believe in media  only working for one class to deviate the topic . When muslims countries do something it will be jihad when other countries do its diplomatic and rational . 
Surely  the Qatari government can stop this man from saying anything that would undermine relations with India. Will they?  We as a nation should have long memory and ready to repay with interest at the appropriate time. As Indian citizens we could do our bit. For a starter stop flying Qatar Airways.
What’s the music for?
Indian government should also raise the topic related to death of more 2000 Indian labourers and 6000 south asian deaths while construction of the road to fifa for Qatar...
Ravishankar sadguru they also go for these tipe of events
Jali na, jali na 
An islam iman ,teacher or scholar not invited to a muslim country tell a lot about the man and his religion .
India have just crossed it's limit over the freedom of a person. Dr Jakir Nayek, didn't go in Qatar by any invitation. He went there by his own purpose, own expenses. India is trying to make some trouble issues with Qatar, which will put the Indians who are living on Qatar and doing businesses...
Even football, cricket are haram 
Islamic community will overlap one other's/ another 's  setbacks/ misdeed everytime
Made up charges after they saw Brother Zakir success in showing Hindus the true path to real success in this world and the everlasting one next one.
Modi ran away from debating zakir naik
Dr zakir Naik is Islamic world hero his place above kings ..since he came Qatar lot of people accept Islam .but I miss the way he used whipp Indian pandits by his knowledge and research
What's the issues with Hindustan times?
Jakir Naik
INDIA HAS TO BE PANISHT AND CHARGE FOR ALL EVIL WHAT DID  TO SEJH ZAKIR NAIK
Fugitive lol not like Indian Swami's 
Who are we Indians to judge Qatar, it's their wish whatever they wanna do and Zakir Naik can go wherever he wants. No body has the right to comment on Zakir Naik.
Qatar ki power dekh rahe ho..tum log...ittu sa Desh hai...socho ye agar India jitna bada hota to...
Good atleast someone here can see how their 57 country also bend when india take tough stand..

Chaddis will say masterstroke but its Qatar the Baap Of masterstroke.  Invited but wouldnt accept it and wouldnt spoil bilateral Relation with India. 1 teer kahi NishaNe.. Wah Qatar Wah Mann gaye apko, Vishwa Guru ko Chunna Laga Diye.

Good job Qatar 
If go visit to see world cup just focus on world cup don't interfere zakir and india problem  if Qatar unhappy ask.them bring zakir to Qatar become they Preacher
May be they are child of ....
I wish I was with Zakir Naik now and met him in person, how wonderful that would be . Someday I'll invite him to beef delicacy 
Once india will master green energy no need to keep relationship  with this nations who think they have money oil and power  .. soon we will have our own dominance
This is exactly why Indians need to use Emirates /Etihad airways instead of Qatar Air if at all they are so insistent on using the middle east / gulf route :) LOL
Thank u Qatar from Ayesha ki (  )
Fake charges in India
Quatar must remember Gulf war and bad memories of Saddam Hussain's attack on Quatar...
So what if he in private visit can they hand over to Indian police ?
Zakir Naik 
I don't know why Secret agencies of India directly kills him or we should take help from Mossad.  But, I know Indian can do it
This time FIFA is most disgraceful
I have seen many clips of Dr Zakir Naik, he never preaches violence. The only reason India band him was because he was becoming too popular.
Well Qatar does many things unofficially. This oil spill diplomacy constraints has to be countered asap.

Showing add inside video while streaming video is not feels nice. Add is covering most of the screen portion and news can't be read. It's disgusting. Losing interest to watch the news. I suggest better your change it. 
☝
Can't India ask Qatar to arrest him on India's behalf and deport to India?
Qatar Salute Remember Zakir Naik is our brother we support him no matter what they say about him
Meanwhile narsighanand roaming freely.
India should leave our beloved brother alone, India doesn’t appreciate him but the rest of the world does, if the rest of the world doesn’t I do.
We indian must love Dr. Naik 
As an Afghan, I don’t get why Indian are so triggered by this. Stop this Islamophobic nonsense. Dr. Zakir Naik does not force people to listen to him when he is preaching nor force them to become Muslims. If people wants to listen they just listen because they want to. A lot of Muslims support him being there because a lot of people from different countries different backgrounds go there and they get to learn the truth about Islam. Long Live Afghanistan 🇦🇫

Islam will not stop by stopping Zakir naik
Zakir Naik should prefer watching the world cup from home, may be Malaysia where he fled. Otherwise, National Investigation Agency might spoil the party.
Qatar and All Muslims  in the world are same.....we all love islam... We are muslim
India didn't even qualify for the world cup,so you can't expect fifa to invite you

Proud to be Muslim , Proud on Zakir Naik ..
Qatar ka per kutar ne wala hai
Bona jaisa lagta hai un ke aage ..
The good news is more than four people are being converted (gharvapsi) since he has visited Qatar.
Don’t be arrogant by saying qutar is a child and on modi aks they are rushing to explain him. Your title shows how media has become sense less. Diplomacy is done through diplomatic channels and not like using foul statements
Full support to Zakir naik
All jealous 
Result nothing bro all gayan
Modi was also not allowed to visit USA till 2014
The title of this video is misleading as Zakir Naik is a refugee preacher - not a fugitive preacher. Shame on the political characteristics of India.

Long Live Dr.Zaki Naik 
Zakir said that foot ball is haram for Muslims......then who is right
Qatar funds Zakir Naik and also anti India activities. So the response is just a hollow excuse
Thought!! Should Modi govt make anti hindu laws in country to preserve the existence of hindus
Well then, what are you waiting for    CBI, NSA, NIA ,       get going.
He had preached the biggest truth for mankind that God is one and clarified this from different scriptures including Hinduism . Is it why u are opposing him??
Bjp and rss were having problems when dr zakir naik converted many hindus Sikhs and Christians to islam that's why they throw him out of the country but now they can't do anything in Qatar
If Qatar can dishonour the protocol to disrespect visiting Vice President of India, honouring a fugitive should make good sense for them. These are done for the same reasons. Named fanatic would have been honoured in the same manner even if he was not a fugitive. He may be nominated for Nobel Peace prize  and win it even. Malala was awarded. Is she heard speaking about hijaab protests and the killings? Is she active in any other cause of interest for the humanity? 
Why don't india arrest him...?
Qatar will pay the price
ZAKIR NAIK WAS OFFICIALLY INVITED BY QATAR ,KYA UKHAD LOGE .
Dr. Zakir Naik a brave man 
Why india hate Zakir Naik
Even if Zakir Naik visited Qatar for FIFA sport event on his own, without an invite from the Qatar Government, he was found to be provided a stage at the FIFA sports venue and was allowed to give ‘Hate’ speeches to international audience there, against Non-Islamic religions....The Qatar Government Should be held responsible for accomodating Zakir Naik for doing so in their own Country....They should not have allowed an India’s ‘Wanted Criminal’ to set foot on their soil at the first place....Allowing Zakir Naik to Land in Qatar and permitting him to give religious speech that too at a sport event itself, clarifies how much ‘Love and Respect’ they have for our Hindustan, and our feelings....Actions speak tons about their intentions, more than words..... Jay Hind.
I'm here only for hateful comments from people who can't travel abroad due to financial issues and asking others to boycott Qatar world cup. Now this is hypocrisy!
So it.means it was an Indian propegenda & nothing....hahaha

Hi, I invite you to Islam and recite to you statement from Allah, "No son (or offspring) did Allâh beget, nor is there any ilâh (god) along with Him. (If there had been many gods), then each god would have taken away what he had created, and some would have tried to overcome others! Glorified be Allâh above all that they attribute to Him!" (Quran, 23:91)

India should have boycotted FIFA.
Dear hindustan times, it's not hate speeches as you mentioned. If he is teaching hindus what their own religious texts are teaching, then hindus need to learn their own religion. A gov't can make anyone a criminal of it doesn't suit their agenda, in this case he's putting thousands of hindus in the right path, and forcing others to rethink that they have been practicing for thousands of years. Allahu  Akbar. There is none worthy of worship but Allah SWT.
LoL to India
Traitor Should be Punished 
Only sangis have heartily pain in their heart 
we proud of Dr Zakir naik
How and why Zakir Naik got visa to attend FIFA and preaching publicly? This event is not a religious event. Qatar should have allowed other Priests too to come and preach according to their faith and belief. Looks like that this FIFA has become more religious than football event. People can’t enjoy the way they wanted and Qatar imposed restriction just for 28-days everything will be ok after the event ie hotels’ bars, swimming pools, beaches will be opened, what a double standard by Qatari government. I hope people will refuse to attend such events if held in any Arab
You can give ticket to sadhvi pragya and expecting Qatar to do what you want.
India is a secular country and should not talk about other theocratic countries like all the gulf countries that are Islamic in nature.
Why that make you jealous? Ask him  questions come right path  to peace.

First of all, why is Qatar playing aplogetic is out of my understanding. Qatar is the host and can invite anyone do its discretion. There are more hate speakers in India under the banner of Hinduvta and no action is taken against them
Qatar will fall down on their own face soon 🇮🇳
Before crticising others you should see your face in the mirror fast...The worse discrimination, pooverty, inequality not even society but in religious bliefs, no of grades in your religion,,.try to remove all those and then dare enough or be eligible to criticise such an wonderful Nation like Quater and wise man like Dr Zakir Nayek....
Who are you? They will Invite whomever they want

If an Hindu poojari can attend an mall inauguration by Mr. Modi then why Dr. Nailk( I have no idea who this man is. ) should be kept out of Qatar ceremony. Qatar is a sovereign country and should not be dictated by outsiders . If India is not happy then Indianstherefore  can stay home. I am surprised that the Ameer is making excuses or playing dumb.
I support Zakir Naik Sahab because Nupur was not get jailed.
This is pure hate he left still they are after him because he knows their religion more themselves

Can’t digest it. Zakir naik is not a football fan. According to him football is haram . And he is a word to word follower of Islam. They way they said yes to beer and lgbtq before and imposed a ban just before two days it’s hard to believe whatever they r saying.
If india and Qatar relation gets worse it will never hurt qatar nobody need India Needs Qatar. Indian employees in qatar make so much money in Indian economy
P / p  ?
Dalit Naik sure but what about the 10000+ dead Indians and the thousands more trapped as indentured labourers. Maybe Modi should’ve talked them about that instead?
That dog should be haunted now.....
Whatever and however you fools do ..Allah will safeguard his servants
Who cares if Indians gonna boycott it. Football is not even considered a sports game in India, billions of people around to watch soccer even if Indians don't want to
Oil over game over then start grazing ships again

Government of India is scared of Zakir Naik hehe Love you Dr.Zakir
Dr Zakir Naik is not a bigot. He’s a practicing Muslim. Who’s only purveying and propagating the beliefs that he is a trained master and as a torch bearer of his particular belief. Why are we going after him as an individual when the fact of the matter is he’s representing a mindset of over 2 billion people across the globe, therefore he is presenting his views which finds acceptance in a significant cross-section of the muslim population which has Islam as its state religion and knowing fully well that these are his views and these are this contributions to religions peace and harmony. The Arabs have chosen to welcome him to such a global event apart from the fact that it perhaps represents a resounding slap to the Indian state which threw respectable people like Nupur Sharma, A Raja under the bus without giving an opportunity to prove their position before the court of law. It’s for the Indian state to ask itself if they have the confidence to hold on their position and walk their talk to speak their mind. 
🤣

Ignore Qatar. Who are they? What are they? Let any Naik vaik kaik go die anywhere. Who cares as long as he's kept away from Indian shores. But one thing's sure, Naik will always miss India, the one country he's not allowed because like all muslims in India he knows India is best for all muslims.
They fear on  dr zakir naik 
The hate speeches against muslims are ok but Dr. Naik never gave any hate speech against the peaceful* hindu community. It's great lie to damage Dr. Naik's reputation. Only because Dr. Naik won't sing to modi's tune. The hindu extremist government led by modi also tried to convince Dr. Naik to come back to India and preach what modi says but he refused because he can't lie like feku.
Zakir is a to faced person. . He didn't even stood by what he said about football.
While many pajeets are boycotting many hindus reverted to islam 
Its better to invite a 
Show the truth...mr zakir naik...he gave islamic dawah..HT much chk all his video footages...n then talk...he is citizen of India.. not terrorist

😂
Zakir Naik= Hindus Mom Crying LoL
Shut up andh bhakts
Zakir naik great
Why did you put Modi's photo with King Tamim.modi is a Tea seller.
Great of greats Dr zakir naik is someone whom nobody can even challenge in his preachings. Many Hindus and Christians scholars tried and all failed. Simple is that when you can’t beat someone by your arguments than show your power which is useless in case of Dr zakir mail.. he’s a true believer and world knows how much competent and authentic he’s… so at the end Muslims are still alive even from last decades international media and other electronic media portraying them too negative.. so being a Muslim it’s duty to spread message of Islam even in any situation of life but peacefully. So if he’s addressing world peacefully what’s an issue. If you have any insecurities about your beliefs or you don’t wanna believe what he says. It’s your choice bro. So enjoy what you wanna enjoy. And let him preach may be many people wants to get benefit from his talk.. All Islamic world needs to set stage for Dr zakir naik especially. May Allah give us hidayat. Jazakallah
If this corrupted government have power then send Ajith Dobal to QATAR   and bring him back to India

Qatar should handover that's criminal to India ASAP.

Islamophobia! Islamophobia! Islamophobia! Nothing else in this video.
He needs to be extradited to India and tried for hate speeches. A fake preaches who is good with words and uses religion as an excuse.

Qatar is Muslim. Pakistan is Muslim. Malaysia is Muslim. I don't know why indians are so confused. Long live Qatar
Love zakir naik from India and hate modi 
fugitive media Hindustan times.
Qatar should have ignored India and not responded to them... 
Zakir Naik
I said shut up
Zakir nalayak
Long Live our Mujahid Dr Zakir Naik 
Massive furious by whom? 
Since when do Muslims cave in to trumped up charges made by idolators?
Lol what hate speech? Proving that youreligion is a joke?
Its a high time God should give the Muslims the khilafa back. The Islamic Republic State would shut all these stupid politics down against Muslims.
👎
Dr Zakir Naik peace be upon him is the pride of Muslims, he is our proud

“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.

It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .

Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳

Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration

It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.

Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.

What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.

There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking.

India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them

I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking

One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.

India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important

Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..

I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”

Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.

Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china
BRO U DIDN'T TOLD ABOUT SPONSERS 
Should have covered about Wuhan virus also...
Keep rocking...
Only a foolish man cries over a torn pocket, the wise man uses it to scratch his balls .
India's leverage is youth more than 600 million but most of them are busy with doing reels in insta and other stuff

Thank You !! : )
Well we had a great chance with web3 industry but our lethargic government let that chance pass out making Dubai hub for web3 projects
hey, did anybody notice, Ganesh bhaiya looks like Veer Sivaji's actor (Paras Arora).
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China.

Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china
BRO U DIDN'T TOLD ABOUT SPONSERS 
Should have covered about Wuhan virus also...

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.

“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.

India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves
The best Indian you tube channel
25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation

I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china
BRO U DIDN'T TOLD ABOUT SPONSERS 
Should have covered about Wuhan virus also...

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.

India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves
The best Indian you tube channel
25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..
In india all free schemes runs the state  governments..
And we are betting on green hydrogen and ammonia hope in future it will give fruitful results
Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa
They're also leading in tokamak technology. They're investing in the future and we're nowhere near them.
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china
BRO U DIDN'T TOLD ABOUT SPONSERS 
Should have covered about Wuhan virus also...

India's leverage is youth more than 600 million but most of them are busy with doing reels in insta and other stuff

Well we had a great chance with web3 industry but our lethargic government let that chance pass out making Dubai hub for web3 projects

once Chanakya said If your enemy is doing something good learn from it
talk about leverage:- 'we have good old sevice sector', I mean just look at number of ideas come's out of india, and we can do somthing like a monopoly on patents, and let's not talk about management

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :
Issliye nitin gadkari and team is focusing on hydrogen based bits
Bro it's democratic republic of congo . republic of congo is a seperate country please see this
You are good, you are very good 
Wonderfull video i have ever watched
😂
Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves
The best Indian you tube channel
25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..
In india all free schemes runs the state  governments..
And we are betting on green hydrogen and ammonia hope in future it will give fruitful results
Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa
They're also leading in tokamak technology. They're investing in the future and we're nowhere near them.

India needs to get into A.I and automation  to catch up or it will become dependent on other nations.
Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.
There is no study material in description ???????

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event!

Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one

as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..

Awesome vdo

“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa

Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.
There is no study material in description ???????

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge

I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?

Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...

Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :
Issliye nitin gadkari and team is focusing on hydrogen based bits

Wonderfull video i have ever watched
😂
Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves
The best Indian you tube channel
25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..

Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa

Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.
There is no study material in description ???????

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.

This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :
Issliye nitin gadkari and team is focusing on hydrogen based bits
Bro it's democratic republic of congo . republic of congo is a seperate country please see this
You are good, you are very good 
Wonderfull video i have ever watched
😂
Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves
The best Indian you tube channel
25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..
In india all free schemes runs the state  governments..
And we are betting on green hydrogen and ammonia hope in future it will give fruitful results
Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa
They're also leading in tokamak technology. They're investing in the future and we're nowhere near them.

India needs to get into A.I and automation  to catch up or it will become dependent on other nations.
Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.
There is no study material in description ???????
camera orientation not aligned with the bg. P.S. Love your content!
Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh
Dar ka mahol 
Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions 
V good
Hydrogen mission will play key role in the Indian economy in the next 20 years
🥶
India is betting on chips and the largest investment are coming to start factories of silicon chips in India
Brother you forgot maanmohansingh 
Good
Takeaway from this is

No one in the Comments Should Comment on India now we can inspire from them but not Copy them Coz we are Democracy
I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down

This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.

One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system

In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.

India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .

What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..

Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions 
V good

No one in the Comments Should Comment on India now we can inspire from them but not Copy them Coz we are Democracy
I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down
15:00
The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich

India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food

“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.

I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.

Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do

Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china
BRO U DIDN'T TOLD ABOUT SPONSERS 
Should have covered about Wuhan virus also...

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves
The best Indian you tube channel
25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .

What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..
In india all free schemes runs the state  governments..
And we are betting on green hydrogen and ammonia hope in future it will give fruitful results
Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa
They're also leading in tokamak technology. They're investing in the future and we're nowhere near them.

India needs to get into A.I and automation  to catch up or it will become dependent on other nations.
Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.
There is no study material in description ???????

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions 
V good
Hydrogen mission will play key role in the Indian economy in the next 20 years

India is betting on chips and the largest investment are coming to start factories of silicon chips in India

No one in the Comments Should Comment on India now we can inspire from them but not Copy them Coz we are Democracy
I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down
15:00
The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich

India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food
Kejriwal should understand it and should not give free electricity and  other things
Why 1 dislikes
India can never go China route because of our political differences, demographic differences, anti India elements thriving here with full privileges..India has been peace lover, lost a huge territory to China as well as Pakistan.. lost the key resources, land routes to Central Asia and created a national security threat for itself by allowing China Pakistan nexus..
India should focus on solar and Nuclear plants...
When China was doing all these what was India and GoI doing ? Sleeping ?
After China becomes a developed country by 2050 next is India's turn!!
India is not losing. It’s playing the same strategy that China had back then.
so green hydrogen is our take
We are busy in election only 
Before taking the existing population into advantage. Central government should as fast as possible bring population control bill.

What india should learn from China? 
No one looks at the things happened in the background.. Nobdy gives a fuck of the hardships, misery, blood and toil they have given to achieve this feat.. Everyone sees this Sentiliting present which they are rejoicing now... Everyone talks abt the theory but not the practice.. What they did and achieve, it's hard to replicate
isn't India already a super power though? does having nukes not automagically make you a world super power. pretty low bar since North Korea also has some.
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?

Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.

One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well

India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian

As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...

In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.

India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .

What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off

What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions

I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down
15:00
The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich

India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food
Kejriwal should understand it and should not give free electricity and  other things
Why 1 dislikes
India can never go China route because of our political differences, demographic differences, anti India elements thriving here with full privileges..India has been peace lover, lost a huge territory to China as well as Pakistan.. lost the key resources, land routes to Central Asia and created a national security threat for itself by allowing China Pakistan nexus..
India should focus on solar and Nuclear plants...
When China was doing all these what was India and GoI doing ? Sleeping ?
After China becomes a developed country by 2050 next is India's turn!!
India is not losing. It’s playing the same strategy that China had back then.
so green hydrogen is our take
We are busy in election only 
Before taking the existing population into advantage. Central government should as fast as possible bring population control bill.

No one looks at the things happened in the background.. Nobdy gives a fuck of the hardships, misery, blood and toil they have given to achieve this feat.. Everyone sees this Sentiliting present which they are rejoicing now... Everyone talks abt the theory but not the practice.. What they did and achieve, it's hard to replicate
isn't India already a super power though? does having nukes not automagically make you a world super power. pretty low bar since North Korea also has some.
Get over with differences atleast now.. bc ldte reh jaoge.. and some other country will steal the prize.. we need to be serious and make the most efficient use of our demographic dividend in industrial revolution 4.0

We have religion leverage
@ThinkSchool, democracy comes with a cost and I think you should stop comparing China and INDIA. For a single Telecom bill, you started using words like a dictatorship. As you grow, you are becoming one of the existing media
The biggest disadvantage india has is the socialist policies we still have. The welfare schemes and freebies. The vote bank policies. Don’t forget that china had to rule with an iron fist and quash any relevant protests of their ppl to reach this economic stage. They committed crimes on its own citizens and used many less than honourable ways to rise. Censoring, propaganda, surveillance, debt trapping, blatantly ripping off products, etc. We need to strike a balance. We need to let ppl lift themselves out of poverty rather govt providing them direct money or freebies. The government’s top priority should be job creation. And we Indians need to get rid of the lazy attitude that govt should do everything for us and start working hard. That’s one thing you can’t criticise the Chinese, they are extremely hard working. We need to strike that work life balance at a national level lol. As Tata said, I don’t want india to be a happy nation more than a wealthy nation.
I believe within India within states internal atmosphere created is not inspiring our youth towards research,,, zero logic TV debates is something needs to be changed
Only one Answer..DEMOCRAZY
People says India is going to surpass China. In reality India is running behind 30 years from china. Though people applaud economic liberalization in 1992, but it was a forced process. Without manufacturing infrastructure it was like a premature ejaculation. It was good for foreign investors, but not that much beneficial for India.
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.

I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :
Issliye nitin gadkari and team is focusing on hydrogen based bits
Bro it's democratic republic of congo . republic of congo is a seperate country please see this
You are good, you are very good 
Wonderfull video i have ever watched
😂
Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..
In india all free schemes runs the state  governments..
And we are betting on green hydrogen and ammonia hope in future it will give fruitful results
Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa
They're also leading in tokamak technology. They're investing in the future and we're nowhere near them.

India needs to get into A.I and automation  to catch up or it will become dependent on other nations.
Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.
There is no study material in description ???????
camera orientation not aligned with the bg. P.S. Love your content!
Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions 
V good
Hydrogen mission will play key role in the Indian economy in the next 20 years

India is betting on chips and the largest investment are coming to start factories of silicon chips in India

No one in the Comments Should Comment on India now we can inspire from them but not Copy them Coz we are Democracy
I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down
15:00
The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich

India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food
Kejriwal should understand it and should not give free electricity and  other things
Why 1 dislikes
India can never go China route because of our political differences, demographic differences, anti India elements thriving here with full privileges..India has been peace lover, lost a huge territory to China as well as Pakistan.. lost the key resources, land routes to Central Asia and created a national security threat for itself by allowing China Pakistan nexus..
India should focus on solar and Nuclear plants...
When China was doing all these what was India and GoI doing ? Sleeping ?
After China becomes a developed country by 2050 next is India's turn!!
India is not losing. It’s playing the same strategy that China had back then.
so green hydrogen is our take
We are busy in election only 
Before taking the existing population into advantage. Central government should as fast as possible bring population control bill.

Green hydrogen fuel may be.......
China is saving the world , in abroad  many save money because of buying china gadgets electronics , otherwise USA canada uK made costs 5 times more
What india should learn from China? 
No one looks at the things happened in the background.. Nobdy gives a fuck of the hardships, misery, blood and toil they have given to achieve this feat.. Everyone sees this Sentiliting present which they are rejoicing now... Everyone talks abt the theory but not the practice.. What they did and achieve, it's hard to replicate
isn't India already a super power though? does having nukes not automagically make you a world super power. pretty low bar since North Korea also has some.
Get over with differences atleast now.. bc ldte reh jaoge.. and some other country will steal the prize.. we need to be serious and make the most efficient use of our demographic dividend in industrial revolution 4.0

China use it's population in right way.
Mao Zedong was pretty much the Chinese Stalin 
to become as chaina we just need to leave ethics and do unethical business and dont care about enivironment animals and democracy
It's for those Indians who become happy by comparing themselves with Pakistan...
China is a great country let it be in ancient time or modern times
Still they won Indo-China war
Study material is missing
Bangladesh is following the same way.
I hope India will hold a power on Hydrogen cells.
bhai apki tabiyat theek hai u r looking really pale
India shows a very clear example of what would China be like had China 
China is going to be most powerful country world has seen in thousands of years.
We have religion leverage
@ThinkSchool, democracy comes with a cost and I think you should stop comparing China and INDIA. For a single Telecom bill, you started using words like a dictatorship. As you grow, you are becoming one of the existing media
The biggest disadvantage india has is the socialist policies we still have. The welfare schemes and freebies. The vote bank policies. Don’t forget that china had to rule with an iron fist and quash any relevant protests of their ppl to reach this economic stage. They committed crimes on its own citizens and used many less than honourable ways to rise. Censoring, propaganda, surveillance, debt trapping, blatantly ripping off products, etc. We need to strike a balance. We need to let ppl lift themselves out of poverty rather govt providing them direct money or freebies. The government’s top priority should be job creation. And we Indians need to get rid of the lazy attitude that govt should do everything for us and start working hard. That’s one thing you can’t criticise the Chinese, they are extremely hard working. We need to strike that work life balance at a national level lol. As Tata said, I don’t want india to be a happy nation more than a wealthy nation.
I believe within India within states internal atmosphere created is not inspiring our youth towards research,,, zero logic TV debates is something needs to be changed
Only one Answer..DEMOCRAZY
People says India is going to surpass China. In reality India is running behind 30 years from china. Though people applaud economic liberalization in 1992, but it was a forced process. Without manufacturing infrastructure it was like a premature ejaculation. It was good for foreign investors, but not that much beneficial for India.
if we put religion outside India then we will be the same
Ganesh but what about the humongous number of people who died in this China's industrial revolution ?
nitn gadkari visted chine in 2017 18 he said that there is nothing communism in china it is a supergrowig country people have freedom and all that actually a stable goverment play a very very crucial role in nation building and boosting economy like the current bjp goverment is boosting the economy.. we need stable governemnt like bjp
India too can grow but only if our gujrati pm help every state like china did. We must follow China not Sri lanka 
India is leveraging human population, in 20years we will the top manpower supplier to world.
Indians when compared to Pakistan: 
Kuch bhi kaho china h toh mind blowing
Software developers
But indians will still compare the country with pakistan rather than china even Bangladesh is ahead of our economy
Ok how manmohan made good policies about India?
The first thing which India needs to learn from them is to become a communist and offer the same lucrative deals to the foreign investors.. Make strict rules which people will have to follow. China's success story wouldn't have been possible if it was a democracy like India.   In India there is a protest for everything . In China a protest is greeted with army tanks like it did in Tianman Square. . So Indians including think school should ask . Are we ready to become a communist nation ?
What was india doing all this time
Hydrogen and solar are the future.
India is superpower saar. India invented flying vimanans & Also first internet used during Mahabharata times. And hanuman was 1st person to go near sun that too without Oxygen.
They have got money and economy but on cost of their freedom.......will  you trade your freedom for money
British taught us divide and rule. Dont let the illiterate learn. Keep them in the way they are. Even now same thing is happening.. since 1947, till now. Politics is the reason.

This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event!

Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.

There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.

One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :

😂
Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem

“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa

Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio

In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.

The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions 
V good
Hydrogen mission will play key role in the Indian economy in the next 20 years

India is betting on chips and the largest investment are coming to start factories of silicon chips in India

No one in the Comments Should Comment on India now we can inspire from them but not Copy them Coz we are Democracy
I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down

The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich

India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food
Kejriwal should understand it and should not give free electricity and  other things
Why 1 dislikes
India can never go China route because of our political differences, demographic differences, anti India elements thriving here with full privileges..India has been peace lover, lost a huge territory to China as well as Pakistan.. lost the key resources, land routes to Central Asia and created a national security threat for itself by allowing China Pakistan nexus..
India should focus on solar and Nuclear plants...
When China was doing all these what was India and GoI doing ? Sleeping ?
After China becomes a developed country by 2050 next is India's turn!!
India is not losing. It’s playing the same strategy that China had back then.
so green hydrogen is our take
We are busy in election only 
Before taking the existing population into advantage. Central government should as fast as possible bring population control bill.
Got a whack for wrong thumbnail bro!!

The world will become a multipolar world, rather than a world dominated by the United States as it is now. Come on India, India has become and will become stronger, and the Asian era has come
Kyushu raho ganesh bhai
Green hydrogen fuel may be.......
China is saving the world , in abroad  many save money because of buying china gadgets electronics , otherwise USA canada uK made costs 5 times more
What india should learn from China? 
No one looks at the things happened in the background.. Nobdy gives a fuck of the hardships, misery, blood and toil they have given to achieve this feat.. Everyone sees this Sentiliting present which they are rejoicing now... Everyone talks abt the theory but not the practice.. What they did and achieve, it's hard to replicate
isn't India already a super power though? does having nukes not automagically make you a world super power. pretty low bar since North Korea also has some.
Get over with differences atleast now.. bc ldte reh jaoge.. and some other country will steal the prize.. we need to be serious and make the most efficient use of our demographic dividend in industrial revolution 4.0
Chinna Full pollution re baba 
China use it's population in right way.
Mao Zedong was pretty much the Chinese Stalin 
to become as chaina we just need to leave ethics and do unethical business and dont care about enivironment animals and democracy
It's for those Indians who become happy by comparing themselves with Pakistan...
China is a great country let it be in ancient time or modern times
Still they won Indo-China war
Study material is missing
Bangladesh is following the same way.
I hope India will hold a power on Hydrogen cells.
bhai apki tabiyat theek hai u r looking really pale
India shows a very clear example of what would China be like had China 
China is going to be most powerful country world has seen in thousands of years.
We have religion leverage
@ThinkSchool, democracy comes with a cost and I think you should stop comparing China and INDIA. For a single Telecom bill, you started using words like a dictatorship. As you grow, you are becoming one of the existing media
The biggest disadvantage india has is the socialist policies we still have. The welfare schemes and freebies. The vote bank policies. Don’t forget that china had to rule with an iron fist and quash any relevant protests of their ppl to reach this economic stage. They committed crimes on its own citizens and used many less than honourable ways to rise. Censoring, propaganda, surveillance, debt trapping, blatantly ripping off products, etc. We need to strike a balance. We need to let ppl lift themselves out of poverty rather govt providing them direct money or freebies. The government’s top priority should be job creation. And we Indians need to get rid of the lazy attitude that govt should do everything for us and start working hard. That’s one thing you can’t criticise the Chinese, they are extremely hard working. We need to strike that work life balance at a national level lol. As Tata said, I don’t want india to be a happy nation more than a wealthy nation.
I believe within India within states internal atmosphere created is not inspiring our youth towards research,,, zero logic TV debates is something needs to be changed
Only one Answer..DEMOCRAZY
People says India is going to surpass China. In reality India is running behind 30 years from china. Though people applaud economic liberalization in 1992, but it was a forced process. Without manufacturing infrastructure it was like a premature ejaculation. It was good for foreign investors, but not that much beneficial for India.
if we put religion outside India then we will be the same
Ganesh but what about the humongous number of people who died in this China's industrial revolution ?
nitn gadkari visted chine in 2017 18 he said that there is nothing communism in china it is a supergrowig country people have freedom and all that actually a stable goverment play a very very crucial role in nation building and boosting economy like the current bjp goverment is boosting the economy.. we need stable governemnt like bjp
India too can grow but only if our gujrati pm help every state like china did. We must follow China not Sri lanka 
India is leveraging human population, in 20years we will the top manpower supplier to world.
Indians when compared to Pakistan: 
Kuch bhi kaho china h toh mind blowing
Software developers
But indians will still compare the country with pakistan rather than china even Bangladesh is ahead of our economy
Ok how manmohan made good policies about India?
The first thing which India needs to learn from them is to become a communist and offer the same lucrative deals to the foreign investors.. Make strict rules which people will have to follow. China's success story wouldn't have been possible if it was a democracy like India.   In India there is a protest for everything . In China a protest is greeted with army tanks like it did in Tianman Square. . So Indians including think school should ask . Are we ready to become a communist nation ?
What was india doing all this time
Hydrogen and solar are the future.
India is superpower saar. India invented flying vimanans & Also first internet used during Mahabharata times. And hanuman was 1st person to go near sun that too without Oxygen.
They have got money and economy but on cost of their freedom.......will  you trade your freedom for money
British taught us divide and rule. Dont let the illiterate learn. Keep them in the way they are. Even now same thing is happening.. since 1947, till now. Politics is the reason.

We Indians still fighting for caste , relegion, reservation. God
Problem with india is caste system which play vital role in suppressing 25-50% of people  who wer dalit, minority and middle class hindus. So india output 50% less always. And proverty never fade away.
Why indian like to make a video about China or that include China? I never seen Chinese made many videos to talk about india.
When china was liberalising in 1979, our Congress party and socialist communist parties were busy distributing freebies and still some people votes for khujliwaal and INC. shame
Q hawa nikal gae, Thumbnail changed.
Aur india me log hindu muslim me aaj bhi busy hai 
Unfortunately we cannot crush resistance to radical reforms like china. Repealing of farm reforms is a prime example
Think School, you have forgotten to think one valid point, China follows communism & dictatorship but India follows democracy. So, its completely nonsense to compare China with India.
Bhakts come over here. Our hunger rate is 127 in 10 years 
China is a Communist country, we don't want dictators here. They have taken a hard approach, it has worked for them. Their approach towards developement is totally different from democratic country like India. There is no point in comparing India with China. 
To all of us here, just look at the developed nation, they will more or less would have a stable govt,
Yeeee!!!!
China's system can never be applied to India. For example, Since 1980s Chinese government used to perform the abortion of the every second child of a couple! Can you imagine this in India? Evey labour should work atleast 12 hours per day. There are no elections in China, unlike India where there is major election for every 6 months. Most of the time of politicians goes in to this. All the energy, money, resources goes to election winning, rather than actual development.
Because china was led by the greatest Asian statesman of modern era deng Xiaoping since 70s. India never got an equivalent to him in leadership. He didn't speak much and silently worked for China's future for 10-15 years. 
Op
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event!

Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.

One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well

India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system

In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.

India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .

What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off

What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions

I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down
15:00
The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich

India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food
Kejriwal should understand it and should not give free electricity and  other things
Why 1 dislikes
India can never go China route because of our political differences, demographic differences, anti India elements thriving here with full privileges..India has been peace lover, lost a huge territory to China as well as Pakistan.. lost the key resources, land routes to Central Asia and created a national security threat for itself by allowing China Pakistan nexus..
India should focus on solar and Nuclear plants...
When China was doing all these what was India and GoI doing ? Sleeping ?
After China becomes a developed country by 2050 next is India's turn!!
India is not losing. It’s playing the same strategy that China had back then.
so green hydrogen is our take
We are busy in election only 
Before taking the existing population into advantage. Central government should as fast as possible bring population control bill.

No one looks at the things happened in the background.. Nobdy gives a fuck of the hardships, misery, blood and toil they have given to achieve this feat.. Everyone sees this Sentiliting present which they are rejoicing now... Everyone talks abt the theory but not the practice.. What they did and achieve, it's hard to replicate
isn't India already a super power though? does having nukes not automagically make you a world super power. pretty low bar since North Korea also has some.
Get over with differences atleast now.. bc ldte reh jaoge.. and some other country will steal the prize.. we need to be serious and make the most efficient use of our demographic dividend in industrial revolution 4.0

We have religion leverage
@ThinkSchool, democracy comes with a cost and I think you should stop comparing China and INDIA. For a single Telecom bill, you started using words like a dictatorship. As you grow, you are becoming one of the existing media
The biggest disadvantage india has is the socialist policies we still have. The welfare schemes and freebies. The vote bank policies. Don’t forget that china had to rule with an iron fist and quash any relevant protests of their ppl to reach this economic stage. They committed crimes on its own citizens and used many less than honourable ways to rise. Censoring, propaganda, surveillance, debt trapping, blatantly ripping off products, etc. We need to strike a balance. We need to let ppl lift themselves out of poverty rather govt providing them direct money or freebies. The government’s top priority should be job creation. And we Indians need to get rid of the lazy attitude that govt should do everything for us and start working hard. That’s one thing you can’t criticise the Chinese, they are extremely hard working. We need to strike that work life balance at a national level lol. As Tata said, I don’t want india to be a happy nation more than a wealthy nation.
I believe within India within states internal atmosphere created is not inspiring our youth towards research,,, zero logic TV debates is something needs to be changed
Only one Answer..DEMOCRAZY
People says India is going to surpass China. In reality India is running behind 30 years from china. Though people applaud economic liberalization in 1992, but it was a forced process. Without manufacturing infrastructure it was like a premature ejaculation. It was good for foreign investors, but not that much beneficial for India.
if we put religion outside India then we will be the same
Ganesh but what about the humongous number of people who died in this China's industrial revolution ?
nitn gadkari visted chine in 2017 18 he said that there is nothing communism in china it is a supergrowig country people have freedom and all that actually a stable goverment play a very very crucial role in nation building and boosting economy like the current bjp goverment is boosting the economy.. we need stable governemnt like bjp
India too can grow but only if our gujrati pm help every state like china did. We must follow China not Sri lanka 
India is leveraging human population, in 20years we will the top manpower supplier to world.
Indians when compared to Pakistan: 
Kuch bhi kaho china h toh mind blowing
Software developers
But indians will still compare the country with pakistan rather than china even Bangladesh is ahead of our economy
Ok how manmohan made good policies about India?
The first thing which India needs to learn from them is to become a communist and offer the same lucrative deals to the foreign investors.. Make strict rules which people will have to follow. China's success story wouldn't have been possible if it was a democracy like India.   In India there is a protest for everything . In China a protest is greeted with army tanks like it did in Tianman Square. . So Indians including think school should ask . Are we ready to become a communist nation ?
What was india doing all this time
Hydrogen and solar are the future.
India is superpower saar. India invented flying vimanans & Also first internet used during Mahabharata times. And hanuman was 1st person to go near sun that too without Oxygen.
They have got money and economy but on cost of their freedom.......will  you trade your freedom for money
British taught us divide and rule. Dont let the illiterate learn. Keep them in the way they are. Even now same thing is happening.. since 1947, till now. Politics is the reason.

In my opinion, this video is more like promotional video of CCP  that  support Chinese propogenda which eventually increase CCP soft power
✌
Rastravadi ke khaal me vampanthi
Chinese people have great contempt for Indians, the fall of China is imp for us.
Happy
Like love
Damn
Jio ka story jaisa
We Indians still fighting for caste , relegion, reservation. God
Problem with india is caste system which play vital role in suppressing 25-50% of people  who wer dalit, minority and middle class hindus. So india output 50% less always. And proverty never fade away.
Why indian like to make a video about China or that include China? I never seen Chinese made many videos to talk about india.
When china was liberalising in 1979, our Congress party and socialist communist parties were busy distributing freebies and still some people votes for khujliwaal and INC. shame
Q hawa nikal gae, Thumbnail changed.
Aur india me log hindu muslim me aaj bhi busy hai 
Unfortunately we cannot crush resistance to radical reforms like china. Repealing of farm reforms is a prime example
Think School, you have forgotten to think one valid point, China follows communism & dictatorship but India follows democracy. So, its completely nonsense to compare China with India.
Bhakts come over here. Our hunger rate is 127 in 10 years 
China is a Communist country, we don't want dictators here. They have taken a hard approach, it has worked for them. Their approach towards developement is totally different from democratic country like India. There is no point in comparing India with China. 
To all of us here, just look at the developed nation, they will more or less would have a stable govt,
Yeeee!!!!
China's system can never be applied to India. For example, Since 1980s Chinese government used to perform the abortion of the every second child of a couple! Can you imagine this in India? Evey labour should work atleast 12 hours per day. There are no elections in China, unlike India where there is major election for every 6 months. Most of the time of politicians goes in to this. All the energy, money, resources goes to election winning, rather than actual development.
Because china was led by the greatest Asian statesman of modern era deng Xiaoping since 70s. India never got an equivalent to him in leadership. He didn't speak much and silently worked for China's future for 10-15 years. 
Op
Hi Everybody, how many agree Think School is best and Ganesh is best teacher
He !!! He !!!! China now combine with Taiwan will become the Super duper power house. Not even the the elephant with. all its trumpeting can come near to that of the Super Dragon. As for the bald headed vulture with it's long vulture neck will can b an equal match on its own. Even with many of its so called allies,together they r no match as compare with the dragon combine with bear & now the tiger of east (Taiwan), it's just a walk over.
We lost 1962 war to this china??
Modi great.
Hydrogen is the key for india
i wish india should have been a  monarchy
I hv frwd this...
Let's hear from economics experts blaming old and new governments in favor of their fav parties
India should learn from China at least now
where is human rights
People wants.
I am an electrical engineer bro, EV is not the future anymore , its HYDROGEN.
Simple go the china way forget democracy turn to communism this will discipline the people train them for hard work.
Iodiotic western nations FDI in China is the simple reason.
And the true superpower country is tangled in hindu-muslim fights.
Throw away majestic God
here money going to swiss
Power of no democracy
Why not India? 
Aur humse sirf hindu muslim karwa lo. Ek number attention and money milega.
This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :
Issliye nitin gadkari and team is focusing on hydrogen based bits

Wonderfull video i have ever watched

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..

And we are betting on green hydrogen and ammonia hope in future it will give fruitful results
Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa

Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions 
V good

No one in the Comments Should Comment on India now we can inspire from them but not Copy them Coz we are Democracy
I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down
15:00
The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich

India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food
Kejriwal should understand it and should not give free electricity and  other things
Why 1 dislikes
India can never go China route because of our political differences, demographic differences, anti India elements thriving here with full privileges..India has been peace lover, lost a huge territory to China as well as Pakistan.. lost the key resources, land routes to Central Asia and created a national security threat for itself by allowing China Pakistan nexus..
India should focus on solar and Nuclear plants...
When China was doing all these what was India and GoI doing ? Sleeping ?
After China becomes a developed country by 2050 next is India's turn!!
India is not losing. It’s playing the same strategy that China had back then.
so green hydrogen is our take
We are busy in election only 
Before taking the existing population into advantage. Central government should as fast as possible bring population control bill.

What india should learn from China? 
No one looks at the things happened in the background.. Nobdy gives a fuck of the hardships, misery, blood and toil they have given to achieve this feat.. Everyone sees this Sentiliting present which they are rejoicing now... Everyone talks abt the theory but not the practice.. What they did and achieve, it's hard to replicate
isn't India already a super power though? does having nukes not automagically make you a world super power. pretty low bar since North Korea also has some.
Get over with differences atleast now.. bc ldte reh jaoge.. and some other country will steal the prize.. we need to be serious and make the most efficient use of our demographic dividend in industrial revolution 4.0

China is going to be most powerful country world has seen in thousands of years.
We have religion leverage
@ThinkSchool, democracy comes with a cost and I think you should stop comparing China and INDIA. For a single Telecom bill, you started using words like a dictatorship. As you grow, you are becoming one of the existing media
The biggest disadvantage india has is the socialist policies we still have. The welfare schemes and freebies. The vote bank policies. Don’t forget that china had to rule with an iron fist and quash any relevant protests of their ppl to reach this economic stage. They committed crimes on its own citizens and used many less than honourable ways to rise. Censoring, propaganda, surveillance, debt trapping, blatantly ripping off products, etc. We need to strike a balance. We need to let ppl lift themselves out of poverty rather govt providing them direct money or freebies. The government’s top priority should be job creation. And we Indians need to get rid of the lazy attitude that govt should do everything for us and start working hard. That’s one thing you can’t criticise the Chinese, they are extremely hard working. We need to strike that work life balance at a national level lol. As Tata said, I don’t want india to be a happy nation more than a wealthy nation.
I believe within India within states internal atmosphere created is not inspiring our youth towards research,,, zero logic TV debates is something needs to be changed
Only one Answer..DEMOCRAZY
People says India is going to surpass China. In reality India is running behind 30 years from china. Though people applaud economic liberalization in 1992, but it was a forced process. Without manufacturing infrastructure it was like a premature ejaculation. It was good for foreign investors, but not that much beneficial for India.
if we put religion outside India then we will be the same
Ganesh but what about the humongous number of people who died in this China's industrial revolution ?
nitn gadkari visted chine in 2017 18 he said that there is nothing communism in china it is a supergrowig country people have freedom and all that actually a stable goverment play a very very crucial role in nation building and boosting economy like the current bjp goverment is boosting the economy.. we need stable governemnt like bjp
India too can grow but only if our gujrati pm help every state like china did. We must follow China not Sri lanka 
India is leveraging human population, in 20years we will the top manpower supplier to world.
Indians when compared to Pakistan: 
Kuch bhi kaho china h toh mind blowing
Software developers
But indians will still compare the country with pakistan rather than china even Bangladesh is ahead of our economy
Ok how manmohan made good policies about India?
The first thing which India needs to learn from them is to become a communist and offer the same lucrative deals to the foreign investors.. Make strict rules which people will have to follow. China's success story wouldn't have been possible if it was a democracy like India.   In India there is a protest for everything . In China a protest is greeted with army tanks like it did in Tianman Square. . So Indians including think school should ask . Are we ready to become a communist nation ?
What was india doing all this time
Hydrogen and solar are the future.
India is superpower saar. India invented flying vimanans & Also first internet used during Mahabharata times. And hanuman was 1st person to go near sun that too without Oxygen.
They have got money and economy but on cost of their freedom.......will  you trade your freedom for money
British taught us divide and rule. Dont let the illiterate learn. Keep them in the way they are. Even now same thing is happening.. since 1947, till now. Politics is the reason.

Problem with india is caste system which play vital role in suppressing 25-50% of people  who wer dalit, minority and middle class hindus. So india output 50% less always. And proverty never fade away.
Why indian like to make a video about China or that include China? I never seen Chinese made many videos to talk about india.
When china was liberalising in 1979, our Congress party and socialist communist parties were busy distributing freebies and still some people votes for khujliwaal and INC. shame

Think School, you have forgotten to think one valid point, China follows communism & dictatorship but India follows democracy. So, its completely nonsense to compare China with India.
Bhakts come over here. Our hunger rate is 127 in 10 years 
China is a Communist country, we don't want dictators here. They have taken a hard approach, it has worked for them. Their approach towards developement is totally different from democratic country like India. There is no point in comparing India with China. 
To all of us here, just look at the developed nation, they will more or less would have a stable govt,
Yeeee!!!!
China's system can never be applied to India. For example, Since 1980s Chinese government used to perform the abortion of the every second child of a couple! Can you imagine this in India? Evey labour should work atleast 12 hours per day. There are no elections in China, unlike India where there is major election for every 6 months. Most of the time of politicians goes in to this. All the energy, money, resources goes to election winning, rather than actual development.
Because china was led by the greatest Asian statesman of modern era deng Xiaoping since 70s. India never got an equivalent to him in leadership. He didn't speak much and silently worked for China's future for 10-15 years.

Hi Everybody, how many agree Think School is best and Ganesh is best teacher

Even with many of its so called allies,together they r no match as compare with the dragon combine with bear & now the tiger of east (Taiwan), it's just a walk over.

India investing in buying mlas and hindu muslim debates
To all here, this is ground reality, though it is stone to digest, 
India needs to inforce the CBDC (central bank digital currency) and expand the bhim upi and digital payment system that we can replace the Swift system . that is the leverage that india can gain over the world
If Indian government goes to invest  5 billion in times of recession in something that is going to be fruitful in decades ,then we the people will be standing in the way of the government. In democracy it’s hard for government too , like our pm  have to focus on winning elections with governance .

India doesn't have 30 years.
Why don't China acquire magnolia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan instead of fighting with India, Taiwan, Burma?
Change the thumbnail man, This is why india was losing.
Why didn’t the Congo just sell the cobalt instead of taking a loan. This seems like a bad deal for Congo.
Chinese are communist but they follow captlist while Indians are republic but follow socialist, Irony.
Here we have given too much democracy the opposition parties are slowing down the infrastructure development projects for eg the bullet train project
This man called Deng Ziaoping! Hahaha. Lol. Deng Ziaoping is the personality of the 2nd millennium. Far bigger personality than Mahatma Gandhi and Narendra Modi. Would you say... This man called Narendra Modi!
Its no doubt that China is futuristic, but there is also dark side to this dominance.  One of the many is below.

This is a must for every Indian Citizen, please watch and leave your thoughts under this comment.
“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.

I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge
Think school Is an way to Teach , Educate and Train Common man of India about India ! 🇮🇳
I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.
Bro, nowdays only a few makes nickel cobalt Ni-Cb battery, most of them makes lithium ion Li-Io, and lithium is abanded in the lithium triangle where the Tesla is mining a lot.
I'm a Sri lankan. We are squeezed in between China India power struggle. China India should corporate rather than having a grudge so we all can prosper.
Informative.
India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.
India tabhi or grow karega jab hamlog keh dimag seh pehle yeh do thoughts nikal jaye :
Issliye nitin gadkari and team is focusing on hydrogen based bits
Bro it's democratic republic of congo . republic of congo is a seperate country please see this
You are good, you are very good 
Wonderfull video i have ever watched
😂
Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .
👍
What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..
In india all free schemes runs the state  governments..
And we are betting on green hydrogen and ammonia hope in future it will give fruitful results
Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa
They're also leading in tokamak technology. They're investing in the future and we're nowhere near them.

India needs to get into A.I and automation  to catch up or it will become dependent on other nations.
Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.
There is no study material in description ???????

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions 
V good
Hydrogen mission will play key role in the Indian economy in the next 20 years

India is betting on chips and the largest investment are coming to start factories of silicon chips in India

No one in the Comments Should Comment on India now we can inspire from them but not Copy them Coz we are Democracy
I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down
15:00
The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich
Kuku fm zindabad
India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food
Kejriwal should understand it and should not give free electricity and  other things
Why 1 dislikes
India can never go China route because of our political differences, demographic differences, anti India elements thriving here with full privileges..India has been peace lover, lost a huge territory to China as well as Pakistan.. lost the key resources, land routes to Central Asia and created a national security threat for itself by allowing China Pakistan nexus..
India should focus on solar and Nuclear plants...
When China was doing all these what was India and GoI doing ? Sleeping ?
After China becomes a developed country by 2050 next is India's turn!!
India is not losing. It’s playing the same strategy that China had back then.
so green hydrogen is our take
We are busy in election only 
Before taking the existing population into advantage. Central government should as fast as possible bring population control bill.

China is saving the world , in abroad  many save money because of buying china gadgets electronics , otherwise USA canada uK made costs 5 times more
What india should learn from China? 
No one looks at the things happened in the background.. Nobdy gives a fuck of the hardships, misery, blood and toil they have given to achieve this feat.. Everyone sees this Sentiliting present which they are rejoicing now... Everyone talks abt the theory but not the practice.. What they did and achieve, it's hard to replicate
isn't India already a super power though? does having nukes not automagically make you a world super power. pretty low bar since North Korea also has some.
Get over with differences atleast now.. bc ldte reh jaoge.. and some other country will steal the prize.. we need to be serious and make the most efficient use of our demographic dividend in industrial revolution 4.0

China use it's population in right way.

China is a great country let it be in ancient time or modern times
Still they won Indo-China war

India shows a very clear example of what would China be like had China 
China is going to be most powerful country world has seen in thousands of years.
We have religion leverage
@ThinkSchool, democracy comes with a cost and I think you should stop comparing China and INDIA. For a single Telecom bill, you started using words like a dictatorship. As you grow, you are becoming one of the existing media
The biggest disadvantage india has is the socialist policies we still have. The welfare schemes and freebies. The vote bank policies. Don’t forget that china had to rule with an iron fist and quash any relevant protests of their ppl to reach this economic stage. They committed crimes on its own citizens and used many less than honourable ways to rise. Censoring, propaganda, surveillance, debt trapping, blatantly ripping off products, etc. We need to strike a balance. We need to let ppl lift themselves out of poverty rather govt providing them direct money or freebies. The government’s top priority should be job creation. And we Indians need to get rid of the lazy attitude that govt should do everything for us and start working hard. That’s one thing you can’t criticise the Chinese, they are extremely hard working. We need to strike that work life balance at a national level lol. As Tata said, I don’t want india to be a happy nation more than a wealthy nation.
I believe within India within states internal atmosphere created is not inspiring our youth towards research,,, zero logic TV debates is something needs to be changed
Only one Answer..DEMOCRAZY
People says India is going to surpass China. In reality India is running behind 30 years from china. Though people applaud economic liberalization in 1992, but it was a forced process. Without manufacturing infrastructure it was like a premature ejaculation. It was good for foreign investors, but not that much beneficial for India.
if we put religion outside India then we will be the same
Ganesh but what about the humongous number of people who died in this China's industrial revolution ?
nitn gadkari visted chine in 2017 18 he said that there is nothing communism in china it is a supergrowig country people have freedom and all that actually a stable goverment play a very very crucial role in nation building and boosting economy like the current bjp goverment is boosting the economy.. we need stable governemnt like bjp
India too can grow but only if our gujrati pm help every state like china did. We must follow China not Sri lanka 
India is leveraging human population, in 20years we will the top manpower supplier to world.
Indians when compared to Pakistan: 
Kuch bhi kaho china h toh mind blowing
Software developers
But indians will still compare the country with pakistan rather than china even Bangladesh is ahead of our economy
Ok how manmohan made good policies about India?
The first thing which India needs to learn from them is to become a communist and offer the same lucrative deals to the foreign investors.. Make strict rules which people will have to follow. China's success story wouldn't have been possible if it was a democracy like India.   In India there is a protest for everything . In China a protest is greeted with army tanks like it did in Tianman Square. . So Indians including think school should ask . Are we ready to become a communist nation ?
What was india doing all this time
Hydrogen and solar are the future.
India is superpower saar. India invented flying vimanans & Also first internet used during Mahabharata times. And hanuman was 1st person to go near sun that too without Oxygen.
They have got money and economy but on cost of their freedom.......will  you trade your freedom for money
British taught us divide and rule. Dont let the illiterate learn. Keep them in the way they are. Even now same thing is happening.. since 1947, till now. Politics is the reason.

Problem with india is caste system which play vital role in suppressing 25-50% of people  who wer dalit, minority and middle class hindus. So india output 50% less always. And proverty never fade away.
Why indian like to make a video about China or that include China? I never seen Chinese made many videos to talk about india.
When china was liberalising in 1979, our Congress party and socialist communist parties were busy distributing freebies and still some people votes for khujliwaal and INC. shame

Think School, you have forgotten to think one valid point, China follows communism & dictatorship but India follows democracy. So, its completely nonsense to compare China with India.
Bhakts come over here. Our hunger rate is 127 in 10 years 
China is a Communist country, we don't want dictators here. They have taken a hard approach, it has worked for them. Their approach towards developement is totally different from democratic country like India. There is no point in comparing India with China. 
To all of us here, just look at the developed nation, they will more or less would have a stable govt,
Yeeee!!!!
China's system can never be applied to India. For example, Since 1980s Chinese government used to perform the abortion of the every second child of a couple! Can you imagine this in India? Evey labour should work atleast 12 hours per day. There are no elections in China, unlike India where there is major election for every 6 months. Most of the time of politicians goes in to this. All the energy, money, resources goes to election winning, rather than actual development.
Because china was led by the greatest Asian statesman of modern era deng Xiaoping since 70s. India never got an equivalent to him in leadership. He didn't speak much and silently worked for China's future for 10-15 years.

To all here, this is ground reality, though it is stone to digest, 
India needs to inforce the CBDC (central bank digital currency) and expand the bhim upi and digital payment system that we can replace the Swift system . that is the leverage that india can gain over the world
If Indian government goes to invest  5 billion in times of recession in something that is going to be fruitful in decades ,then we the people will be standing in the way of the government. In democracy it’s hard for government too , like our pm  have to focus on winning elections with governance .

Why get so excited about some else's formula and without knowing if it stands the test of time? 100/200 years or less of an experiment doesn't really prove anything, India is a time tested society and a collective of amazing people ( specifically the rural ), it's so organic and natural that your young (2-300 years old ) theories would be simply consumed to oblivion. Wait, watch & tune yourself and observe an amazing amalgamation of the ancient with the future. Tune!!!
This is why Modi is a failure. I am from Gujarat. I have been hearing about solar in Modi's speech since 2007. Result ? He made India the biggest consumer of solar panels . No significant effort on making Solar panels .

yep, but forget to mention that economy of a communist can grow double the size of democratic country due to rules and regulation. plus china most faulty thing is that they have state based only for one sector so. if one goes berserk then whole region.

“In a country well governed, poverty is something to be ashamed of. In a country badly governed, wealth is something to be ashamed of.”
The basic problem with India 🇮🇳 is that here the time period between an idea and it's implementation is so huge that sometimes current affairs becomes history till that idea gets implemented.
Today, India stands on that position where China stood 30 years ago. Though our old governments had done mistakes , we should step forward not criticizing them but learning from their mistakes.
" 
I studied medicine in china. During our first year, we had to learn chinese and believe me our teacher was so so good. In one of her classes she told us how her childhood was. Food was not there for anyone. If they want to eat meats they used to wait for months. And thats how they felt ok with any meat. Today in her sixties she is retired and is doing world tour. Currently she is in europe. I see her having fun. But she used to tell us that these are effort of one full generation. The generation full of misery. Now they are happy 
If we want india 🇮🇳 to become a superpower then we have to make every indian a super human through education.
China poverty rate at 1980: 
Delivering two such videos with extremely good content is no mean feat. Think school has been doing this every week. Kudos to the entire team and my brother Ganesh , you are an absolute gem. My love and respect towards this channel is increasing with every passing week.
We seriously need this guy as our teacher 
A must watch video for Indian who feel happy by comparing with Pakistan but actually we should be comparing with china I know china is a lot more ahead than india but we should be hopeful that india and china become friends and improve cooperation
You are the only Youtuber who actually shows us the real picture. Other Youtubers only try to impress the Indian Audience 
I still remember speech of Narendra Modi in 2002 where he mentioned solar will be new power within 20 years then he started distributing solar cooker on subsidised rate I remember when my father brought that home and we used to cook rice in that cooker. I am from Gujarat by the way.
Making money is action. keeping money is behaviour. Growing money is knowledge

I love to watch videos related to countries' economies.  Keep uploading such types of videos!! 
Visionary leader Shree Nitin Gadkari has already started working on hydrogen batteries to counter China's control on the EV market hope hydrogen batteries become reality in India🇮🇳
Chinese play long term game very well. Also because of competent government and having 1.4 billion people which is very homogeneous and are supportive to the government the rise of China to become the most powerful Nation is inevitable.
They did everything they could on Ground level while india's policy is only seen on paper.. That's the difference which made them superpower.. Moreover they support talent.. Its wrong if we only criticize them and don't learn anything from them
Although I'm bio student but still love to watch all these case study on ur channel.
It would be interesting to study how much time people spend on internet countrywise and on which content, demographics, productivity wise.
Being an European I don't hear such excellent analysis in our Western media.Thanks for sharing such wonderful video!
The only unbiased channel in India that speaks about Indian and World economy and politics.
If my father or any adult sees this in the news(Hindi) they are gonna be in awe of what they have done and what we're doing is still far from what we need to do
Think school multi-talented men
You are doing great work with these Case Studies 
That's really a Mind boggling case study ....thanks for this case study  brother keep going 
Hats off to foresight of Chinese leaders. No words to express gratitude once again for your excellent analysis on geopolitics. But India it is not possible at all.
Being an engineer i am glad this channel exist, else i would have never knew this much geo politics, history and mba 
others try to insult or overly praise india . this man is very realistic and factual .
Your content is pure gold! Every video I watched in this channel is highly informative, well-organized and captivating! Keep up the good work.
When you dont have a competition, you can just get things done. In india every bill needs political maneuvering. 
Bro, you are doing an amazing job! Love your assessment of topics and engaging explanations to the topics
Damnnnnn I don't want to miss even a single word that you speak that's how much interesting it is , not just business students
This video is a stunner, great research, very well presented as always.
Great content and very nicely covered details 
watch all your videos. they are perfect and it's the reason I start to study geopolitics further. saw your videos on how Sri Lanka lost its track and how it get stuck in the debt trap. that is very well explained.  if possible do a video on Sri Lanka on how it can become a giant in the world and what possibilities and opportunities it has in the world. 
Very well point mentioned and well explained.  It is very easy to crticise China, just open a Western  media. But look what China is doing without invading other country. If BRI project gets going, Asia will be next center of the world.
I love your video, it’s always well informed and thoughtful. Very eye opening. Keep up the good work. I subscribed.
Very impressive episode. Nations are built great by their visionary leaders. Leaders who can see the future few decades down the line. USA did same with OIL , China doing the same with Cobalt , solar panels , silicon .
Chinese transformation is truly remarkable. i hope India does the same to become a developed nation
if you create a course on how you learn yourself, i'd buy that instantly. that curiosity and hunger to learn must be on a different level.
Very nicely presented ....great Job mate 
Just like China has 'Art of War' for their dream of global dominance, India also has 'Arthashastra' by Chanakya which is more powerful book compared to the one of China. But the fact is they have applied all rules and executed all the plans properly whereas we don't even have bothered to read that book.
Well researched content. Good to learn from you!
This is probably the best YT channel I watch right now. Thanks for the awesome content.
Hats off to this guy 
Thank u dear brother... Most valuable information i known about chinese economic achievements.... Thank u
Think school should applaud it's audience 
EXACTLY WHAT WE WANTED to UNDERSTAND  
Please make a video on the last question you asked about India ! We need more positives about our country and also the inspiration for the leaders of future
This channel must grow by every means
The thing that amazes me the most is how they made their infrastructure look so futuristic with almost 50 cities looking better than any Indian city.
you got world wide audience for a reason. Great work.
The main reason is leadership. China was led by  engineers while India was led by Lawyers
Commenting before watching bcoz i know it's gonna be worth my time sir! 
What a masterpiece content, hats off
I think Green Hydrogen will create next wave of energy revolution that's for sure. Green Hydrogen has potential to decarbonise entire Steel Industry, Auto Industry, Cement and other manufacturing processes as well which will create a wave of adoption down 15-20 years later.
When we were in school in 90s, we were being taught of how Singapore improved in 20 years. China has learnt and started implementing it in a better way while India is still learning..!!
How I wish India 🇮🇳 had the gumption to take bold steps and develop like China 🇨🇳
Deeply in love with the work you do
Thank you for this video. I have a request, can you make a video on what India is doing like you said, I didn't find any hopeful govt. policy like china did in past.
Brilliant analysis and presentation 
Ganesh, your line at 6.14(after she graduates) made me so happy because unlike others you did not use HE while addressing a child. Thanks for such thoughts.
Enjoyed the content, stunning delivery
Oh my god. What a video. Mind blowing. Thank you Ganesh!
Amazing video and thank you for breaking it down!!
I have also read that during 1980's China wanted to make Shanghai become like Mumbai , Chinese thought that Indians were successful . But now Mumbai wants to become Shanghai .
Brilliant video with key focus on importance of long time strategy.
Everytime first i like the video then I'll start to watch.... showing some gratitude 
Ganesh please do make videos on business case studies as well.
Ur videos will contribute to visionary. 
It s not only about how india teach from China..we as Indian s also teach from china how  to be a futurestic
Really like that you end on such a note that provokes deep thoughts, i find your content of really high quality. keep up and Thanks!
Very well put. Just to add the resource availability required for solar and EV is in favour of China.
The failed ventures/investment/bet of China Should be also presented as they give an idea as what failed why and how to avoid it in future.
Very nice case study, instead of throwing badmouth on China unlike others, you have taught what we can learn from them.
Great content..keep uploading more frequently..
Xi Jin ping is my inspiration 
Can you please 
Ganesh I eagerly wait for your videos. Make them more frequent.
this video is content is really mind blowing.. u did this reserach and present to us...
What if it was not a master plan? What if it was the most logical way to proceed at that point of time for china. They had a huge rise in industries and eventually pollution caught up during 2007, and they thought that investing in clean energy was ideal for the nations benefit. And eventually this all happened then everything fell in place.
Hi Thinkschool, what happen to the construction issue that china was facing ? Isnt it just 6 months back that issue arised ?
Even if one criticizes china every time but we should accept and praise its policies and governance, today where india stands, china is ahead of 40 to 50 years, even if india is considered 5th global economy in the world but inside problems of India have remained whether it's poverty, starvation, unemployment, inflation, education, health or migration, there are so many people who don't get 2 times bread.
Hey man how do you do all of your research and how do you choose your topics?
I think kuku fm has enough YouTube content creators sponsored that it can hold it's own YouTube fanfest event! 
😂
Great video Ganesh! You may keep a plant beside you, it’ll look more aesthetic.
Sir
There are few more things they did right; a. Confucius Institutes, Acquiring Large Movie Companies in US, Investing in big gaming companies (to use as subtle influence). All in all lots of thinking. Lastly, lets add Higher Education, World Class Infrastructure, On-time delivery of projects, and disciplined workforce.
In India manufacturing is a nightmare with approvals and compliance....we are yet to see a single authority to give all approvals in flat 90 days...Dholera is developing in that way but it is yet to get that boost...
Very Insightful viewpoint, Thanks for the topic.
महान विद्वान व्यक्तियो में से एक चाणक्य ने अपने चाणक्य संहिता मे लिखा है हर महान राज्य के मूल मे अर्थ होता है। इसलिए एक मजबूत अर्थव्यवस्था ही महानता कि निव है। जय हिंद
One of the best videos YET!!
India is not losing ,we just lag behind ,now we should learn from previous mistakes ,then we definitely grow
Just imagine, what happens if netaji subhashchandra bose would become prime minister immediately after 1947,he is the one who had well designed planning for our industrial policy, our banking system, our defence policy, foriegn policy
India has one of the largest reserves of Thorium. An experimental thorium reactor (first of its kind) is also built in India. If India can leverage this and do more research and development, it is possible that a few decades from now, India will produce the worlds most efficient nuclear fission reactors as well as the first nuclear powered rocket.
Awesome analysis,
Thank you sir to give such a amazing information
I want to know your process of making indepth observation. 
Thank you for this analysis
Love the way Jinping scolded Trudeau.
Love the way he pronounces ‘wold’. It sounds cute. 
I think investing on following 3 resources will help to take India ahead in the game:  "Skilled education to working force" ,  Green Hydrogen and IT. Well we are ahead in IT but we need to keep a strong edge in it. Green Hydrogen investing started with a bang but I feel the interest is fading out. And well for skilled education dont know when we will be lucky to have them at efficient position in lawmakers.
You didn't mentioned that companies which established in china have to submit their I .P documents to govt
This video was very much 
Man quality of your content 
As an outsider of india, i can't say what india should do internally but externally: please initiate good relation with china , don't let westerners play the divide and conquer game with asians AGAIN.
Very educative presentation
The most addictive channel...on YouTube
Well Researched Content..
If we had taken the right move then Our Nation Have becomed a SuperPower like China 
Great work dude 
Our current PM is doing similar job as Deng xiaoping. Hope he succeeds.
Right now with the minimum knowledge I have i can firmly say that if and only if the green energy projects that has been undertaken by government and big giant like Adani, get executed properly only then India may have a chance of domination over the world but that too is not enough. I guess we have to take more steps further to create monopoly on various fields so that area of dominance gets increased and that would help us to become the next super power...
That was such a mind bloglining 
this is one of your best videos for me.
Thank you for your channel that I learned about Deng.
Good content bro...keep Rocking
in the BJP rule i clearly see the changes from past 10 years and its our responsibility to make its tenure of 20 more years then we can the capabilities of indians 
If you remember a company named Moser Baer which was a big name in CDs. They invested heavily in solar panels. In the 2000s they literally begged for support from the UPA government. UPA killed the local solar industry.
So to summarize :- "China did huge amount of targeted and specific Capex expenditure which is paying them back heftily".
But Prasad bro 🇨🇳China is facing gdp down going what do think about it please make video on it 
Hi, I like the content from this channel, but keeping focus with a calm mind with a tensed background score is really hard. May be this is just me, but I would be glad to watch your content with lower sound level possible if not a different background score.
Please make videos in higher quality now. It is better. But anyways your content is very good 
India is spending around 3% of the GDP on education whereas china spends around 11% in terms of value in dollars, it is 13 Billion dollars by India and 830 Billion dollars by China and we have almost the same populations, so we can imagine the quality of their education.
The leverage we have as a nation over China and the US is that we have been observing and following them for quite some time and have developed ourselves to do whatever they both can do at the same time. We have been making tremendous efforts in the past decade or so to make ourselves one of the most efficient and cheap Information Technology hub in the whole world after observing the US and mimicking their success. The somewhat recent Make in India initiative by the government has also allowed us to open the wide population of India as a labour alternative to China as it gets more and more expensive for manufacturing just because their economy has developed so much.
Absolutely insightful. We have to give credit to China where it deserves. Though yes, ofcourse that's the autocratic country and we are democratic but still we need to keep our head down and work towards our goal without getting ourselves involved into unnecessary things.
Mind-blowing video . Every policy maker in India should watch it .
Thank you for the THINK50 coupon!
Sir thank you for the video.please try to make a case study of bombay shaving company.
USA 🇺🇸: "Capitalism?" 
✊
Another point you are missing is that there is no mad rush for technical or medical education...at the lower level people focus on skilling the labour force....entire education system is in Chinese with english as business language...
The most awaited video which I was waiting from many days 
What is the leverage India has ? ANSWER: If there is one Sadhguru jagadeesh vasudev in one state, and if temples are freed and maintained properly and if handled properly India will be a place to visit atleast once for every human in the world, India will be hub of spiritual well being, Tourism and internal well being are the super strengths of India Just that we need proper gurus like Sadhguru
Make a case study video on Singapore as well
🌺
India should invest more in education universities and  r&d.
Lessons that India can learn and implement.
Our economic reforms were forced by the IMF ....And that time narsimha Rao was pm and manmohan singh was the fiance minister.
But the batteries with NMC are prone to catch fire. Nickel Manganese Cobalt Lithium compositon.
Sabka time aega. One day even our  GDP graph too will be like China's
China can control what their people can watch , they show more and more patriotic videos , They utilize their time more efficiently than Indian 
I love the grounded reality of this channel!! Despite the recession, I'm so happy withdrawing my $94k profits out of my investment with a platform in town.•√✓
Bharat IS FOCUSING ON GREEN HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGY.... IT IS THE FUTURE....
As responsible citizens of India, rather doing debate on what India is doing and what other countries are doing. We should be looking around ourselves and taking charge to make our nation, a global super power. From my side, if we are able to make the beggar of India a part of a working community then we may see something good coming.
Such a informative knowledge
I am heavily waiting for the India's leverage. It will be very interesting.
Some other sector I could think of is Semiconductor. They are investing in it heavily. Can anyone think of other sectors? 
I work for the US company and my role is to identify supplier which offers best features & low cost so that we can reduce production cost to develop machines in USA & Europe. And guess what ??? it's always China which has solution for all products. They have huge stock , low price and extremely quick support. The suppliers of China give there best so that the client is fully satisfied. I also check my Indian supplier and I always face issue. First thing is I always have to call and inform supplier that I have send you a mail please check else no one ever replies . Vendors are so satisfied with existing clients that they don't efforts to grow there buisness. I always struggle and feel bad that our Indian mindset is not to explore new opportunities.
Meanwhile in our country our Supreme leader is busy taking care of his friends adani and ambani. rich becoming richer.
As in anytime period 
Excellent research great sir
India can leverage on agriculture "feed the world". As traditional agricultural economy R&D should be intensified multi fold to cater to global warming looming over us.
Indian politics is moving towards freebies
That's why educated people leave our country. As a future dentist i am preparing for IELTS
I think India is as of now aiming to achieve same with hydrogen fuel. We lacked very fundamental thing i.e. internal infrastructure. That's only reason I support this government. Fast and cheap freight movement within the country is extremely important
Great video 
But Indians want government job.
In India the financing for Business is biased towards big businesses. Govt said it gave millions in Mudra loans and I haven't met a single person who has availed it. There are thousands of schemes for MSMES and go try to avail a single loan and none of them will issue them. The COVID business relief was another joke on Indian business man.
The biggest difference between India and china is its citizens. They literally have 9-9-6 culture, meaning, they all work 9 am to 9 pm for 6 days a week. Here in India, there is a culture of taking advantage of the system. Be it through caste, religion, nepotism or numbers. We do not want to work, we want benefits and fun. We have democracy, but as a citizen we are not playing the right role. China is doing better and we must learn from them, like they learnt good things from us.
I had no idea China was so insightful to invest in solar while continually taking losses until the cost of manufacturing cost dropped below coal in MWh, all while consolidating the entire chain of production within their borders - genius to say the least.
Please make case study on Vietnam growth story
Hello Ganesh sir
A single government that rule for 60 years is the main reason for success. Otherwise China could not have carried out such long vision strategy that spread over several generations leaders
China maintained solar companies by paying them for 15 years and in India we are privatising everything just to become United States of Adani 
Spirituality and Yoga for sure..  biggest soft power of India will be this!
great video 
Napoleon Bonaparte once said about China 🇨🇳 - “There lies a sleeping giant. Let him sleep! For when he wakes, he will shake the world.”
This video is just amazing, hats off to you and your entire team. Being a patriotic Indian I want to hate China, but all this is refraining me to do so. We need to accept the fact that how courageously and smartly they have worked for themselves. I would also like to request you that, kindly cover India this way as well like where will we be in some 2-3 decades later with the current policies and economic condition.
No doubt
What a video 
India needs to leave the hate fueled religious division aside and must work consistently and real hard to capitalise on our strengths that are gonna be China's weakness going forward as china is really gonna struggle due to their own inflicted wounds under authoritarian meanwhile we need to really broaden our economic strategy that not only the top folks n companies but a larger part of the country develops to the tune that a v strong and large economic base is established which will be much larger than China if only our government leaves behind trickle down outlook
Great one 
When there is an underdeveloped country with 6 babies per woman then there are two models of development:
as much as i dont like to say it, i am very astonished by the brains of CHINA. I hope INDIA(we) will also do something revolutionary in terms of growth
It worked for China due to CCP and not due to the people's will...CCP was able to take decisions faster without opposition...India is a vibrant democracy but it is also it's curse as decision making and implementation is slow in a democratic setup... handover India to the CCP and you will be astounded to see the pace at which this country grows...
You din mention about the AI and other high end techs which China is leading and investing heavily on
What India is lacking compared to China are long term strategic leaders like this host. This host is of that caliber; intelligent and articulate. 
Make a case study regarding leverage that india has on Geopoliticals.
A deep fate for our india...... 
Great visionary of China. But it is possible for the countries with continuous power in the hands of a visionary. For democratic countries, it is a nightmare 
India's GDP was slightly higher than China's in the 70s. China eventually leaves India in the dust. I know, it is shocking.
This great content!!!
India shall learn from China. Especially those corrupt selfish ministers who look forward for their own benefits, rather than using politics for development. Democracy has both pros and cons, and India is suffering because of downsides of democracy. We can't blame only politicians for it.  The public are responsible for it. They consider intrinsic as more important and that's why this nation suffers.
I see Pundit Nehru n Narendra Modi, i hope people before saying anything understand what was Situation of our India in 1947 and the kind of massively Inequal and poor society it was
That light in studio is mildly influerating
The simple answer is, because there is political will from the government of China. Secondly, Chinese leaders make decisions for the long term. And in my opinion, Chinese citizens are more cocehesive and a willingness to work together that benefits the whole country. I would imagine it is not easy to govern a population of over 1 billion spanning many diverse geographic regions.
I watch this videos for education. I know I cant contribute in helping country as if now but, I think we can by choosing the educated and experienced minister with diplomatic vision for future. I dont have a voting card but you do.
If China can do it India can do it too! India need to focus on two key areas - economic/industrial development and social well-being of the people. Stay away from weapons and alliances with the Western countries.
Why think school not in kannada????? 
Only by the power of dictatorship China became what China is today, Even USA/UK/Germany has ugly past of slavery, colonialism and dictatorship that enabled them to become superpower. But seems India lost that train because our Congress govt was nothing but an extension of British rule only, and now we're clinging on to democracy which is doing nothing but disabling India's growth. India needs a strong dictatorship rule and then we can have the luxury of being called a democratic nation etc
The main problem of India is its population
Great video 
Great video 
It is easy for authoritarian regime to do anything in short time. For democracies with lot of bureaucracy and corruption it is complicated, yet these democracies also develop, but it will be slow. In Democracies, there will be many hurdles many think tanks and everybody wants to make their idea flown high. So it is complex. In authoritarian, one guy thinks and in China one right guy took right decisions. In the same position, currently one guy is taking wrong decisions which will have reactions after decades and may end up in wars.
Also talk about the 45 trillion debt on China ,even India can take 20 trillion dollars and do development fast ,but we don’t fall for debt traps and will grow slowly and steadily over the years
It all boils down to Industrialization and Urbanization. US is 82 percent Urbanized and hardly 10 percent people work in agriculture. India is 40 percent Urbanized and 44 percent people depend on agriculture. So we have less tax collection
Great video major advantage and also disadvantage is 1 party for the entire country. I think that's what BJP is trying to do .
According to me
It took a freaking 30 years for china to generate a 3 trillion dollar economy way back to the 20th century ,BUT to india it's just 5 years. let's see what happens in the near future 🇮🇳🇮🇳
I could only wish India would progress and develop like China so USA would have to choose which country she needs to go to war with.
You are the one from very few peple eho provides notes and researched things.
The video critically ignores the vital role Communism has played in China's growth.  When Apple builds a factory with special conditions, the Party makes direct profits from land leases around the factory (since there is no private land ownership in China because of the Marxist economic system, being a Communist party boss is basically like being a senior manager in "China Land Ltd.").  Furthermore it was under Mao and not Deng that China experienced the most rapid economic growth.  "surpassing the UK's steel production" was a heady milestone under Mao just as "surpassing the USA in X" is today.
Very nice info
Nationalisation of existing private units and introduction of Licence Raj proved to be disastrous for our nation.
China did something that all farmers know well; To get anything to grow, you have to sacrifice the seeds!
We must learn from China how to grow Jai shree Ram
Plz make vedio on uniform civil code
Great explanation of "Globalization". Remember it's American companies and the transfer of American manufacturing to China that made China wealthy.
Very good video.
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries and even Russia is considering Chinese Yuan for trade . End of Dollar is near
Another factor ignored is that the West actively supported China and were happy to help it grow because they wanted to turn it away from the USSR so they had a good reason to help the country keep growing and they assumd in the 2000's as it liberalized it would somehow naturally become democratic.
Much to learn from a great nation China, unfortunately expect communism nothing much is learnt in India. Every leader must watch this.
"Failing to plan is planning to fail"...
India can beat on hydrogen fuel cars and also need PM like "Nitin Gadkari" who can understand language of development.
China may have also taken other bets which have failed... want to know about them also.
Look, one point can't be ignored that China is a autocracy.......China does not face certain problems that India faces, example there are so many ngos in India that stops infrastructure development in the name of nature conservation
Chinese leadership is the most visionary,strong,nationalist,
China doesn’t live on socialism unlike India where everything starts from free. As long as India will give priority to free loading it will keep where it is.
Also since only 1 party remained in the power there were no such big conflicts in decision which made china to take rapid decisions inreturn they were able to utilize the resources well
India became ungovernable when the British Raj left.  The best option for India is to apply for EU membership and join NATO to realize her imperial ambitions.
Excellent talk
The policies of China cannot be replicated due to ethnic religious diversity. The Indian public by and large is indiscipline.
As a Chinese, I would tell you the facts that, Chairman Mao have much higher position than Deng in the people. Deng is a great leader, Mao is more than great.
Have to appreciate their leaders futuristic thinking!! 
Comparing Democracy with Communism is like comparison between apples and bananas. Democracy does work for a small population like USA but with our big population THE GROWTH DOES TAKE TIME and we cannot give away our right to speech.
Mind blowing 
One thing I can say is that China's BRI is resulting in a big failure with most of the Chinese loan recipient countries going through economic and debt crisis like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Syria yes China gave around 130 Billion USD as loan to Syria for rebuilding, and many other African countries.
To all those who give the credit to IMF and manmohan singh. the actual credit goes to PV Narasimha Rao. Sonia Gandhi hated him for not listening to him and he truly was a BJP friend . Manmohan Singh was able to implement this as PV was behind him and protected the coalition government from falling. PV can speak Russian, German and 16 more language fluently and is a true statesman. You may ignore him but the truth shall prevail!
I think you should also mention China's unique political system or the lack of one. A democracy will always take time to rise and have many more stumbling blocks along the way. The way some of the current superpowers got where they are today is through utter disregard for nature and populace. Doing something like that in India will be next to impossible because everyone has an opinion about everything. India needs to start with Eminent Domain and then go from there.
Mind blowing 
As an Indian I think Sometimes democracy will become curse
good video make more these type of videos
@think School please make in comparison to this video what did India did wrong that it is still fighting to emerge
please put this recorded session
As a business student The china story is really interesting and makes future business students happy . However as an Indian it's sad that our old governments stuck to handing out rations and subsidies rather than inviting businesses and embracing the good parts of capitalism. Also can talk about how India stood mute while china just steam rolled tibet :)
although the Chinese achievement is very commendable, this model of development is very inefficient in terms of energy and capital required to achieve every unit of growth... which will be easily rejected in a democratic country like India, as the costs will become visible over time (as it is evident in Chinese private and government debt figures as well as energy crisis)
Make a video about comparison on hydrogen car and electric vehicle .
Make a video on asha.... Revolution of indian healthcare system
So this fellow basically bats for anyone who fills his pockets....Shame...
however with rise there is also sun set... and now its declined in their power
In india plan initiated by one government will not be carried by other government , they dump the previous government plans.. Atleast present government is initiating new ideas..Hope so it will be carried forward
Clear headed Indians like this guy is rare
Despite these developments there is no one to talk about dark realities behind these achievements in china

China is simply returning to its historical superpower status, which it has been in the world since ancient times. In Chinese history: The Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220) accounted for about 26% of the world's GDP, the Tang Dynasty (618-907) accounted for 54% of the world's GDP, and the Song Dynasty (960-1279) accounted for 60% of the world's GDP, according to conservative estimates. The Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) accounted for 45% of the world's GDP, while the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) accounted for 33% of the world's GDP. In addition, 1: China has a history and culture that motivates the Chinese people to make continuous efforts. Chinese people also have a strong sense of national mission and national honor. 2: In China's 5000 years of history, Chinese culture has never been interrupted. The Chinese people have been good at doing business and cultural exchanges since ancient times. The Silk Road between China and the Persian countries in ancient times, and the Silk Road later brought Marco Polo from Italy to China and the economic, trade and cultural exchanges between China and Europe. Zheng He of the Ming Dynasty led his fleet through the Indian Ocean to Persia and Africa, which was 100 years earlier than Columbus's great discovery of Western geography. In ancient times, the friendly economic, trade and cultural exchanges with India, especially the religious and Buddhist exchanges, were never interrupted. In the past thousands of years, China and India never broke out war, but the situation changed after the British colonized India, until the end of World War II, the British left behind the McMahon Line, which eventually led to the geopolitical conflict between China and India.

India is working on Green Hydrogen Gas
china got success  due to his visionary leadership but   in our India  political parties  start thinking for next election after winning and if any government bring good reform then others parties don't support so how can India repeat china growth story?
You can hate them. But you can't ignore them.

Value investing personified by China on solar and EV
Simple note never depend purely on others
Excellent video as always but you forgot to mention few things, even though china become 2nd largest economy it somehow still has cheap labor and materials but how? America and europe once also had cheap labor but after they developed so did the people's salary this is the normal issues for any country but not china because of "currency manipulation", Also foreign investment alone is not enough to lift a gaint country like china the in addition to fdi the govn invested in local brand initially was just a copycat of western products but as time passed the started to innovate, improve product quality and the results are companies like huawei, dji, alibaba, tencent and so on they did this by directly buying foreign technology or even hiring foreign scientists themselves

25% of apples production i.e 50 billon dollar is estimated to set up in India due to China harsh policies. Is that correct?
Well I think India's leverage is trust and India should control the Aerospace and nanotechnology space.
Gr8 brother 
God!! i love China!!
" what will be the leverage India have over the world 
super … thinking about india where we will be in this race 
One question, do the Chinese government provide “revdi” to their citizens?
We need more leverage. Like finding lithium reserves, cobalt reserves. Implementation of SEZs, EUV Lithography & Chip Manufacturing,  Thorium Reactor, Priority for R&D in medicine, high yielding pest & disease resistant crops, priority for hyper futuristic & high precision farming, Attaining a strong market share in the global renewable energy markets, and in the manufacturing of indigenously developed solar cells. Ample availability of funding and loans for Startups & MSMEs, mudra alone can not help and it isn't sufficient. School level training in Job based apprenticeship, which are still missing in our education policy. Early implementation and priority for space mining, what ever is possible.
To end poverty one generation must go to school, just one generation and the rest happens on its own. I think think school must make a video on how we can improve the human resources of India
I have send mail to join master communication class however there is no reply from your side or please tell me when the class gonna start
Hey think school please make a video on Suzlon energy
One of the best Video
Exactly right. Also, why do you keep saying "X years back"? Where did you learn that from? It's "X years 
Thank you
Bro where is star bucks case study i couldn't find it
Our politicians are the biggest problem
Can we believe in figures given by chinise authority.debt is mouting on it .lets see in future .

What India needs to learn?
Epic!
Policy like this should actually be implemented in our country....India.. but that has to be actually, as the term suggests not manipulation that we are doing it we'll do it etc n all...we need to unite and make India the next manufacturing hub so that we can beat China as well as US in near future...30-40years coming..
Startup case study kab ayegi 
Bharat needs to urgently stop cut, copy, pasting global standards. 
Now indian government specially modi and nitin gadkari hydrogen gas (liquid hydrogen) futuristic project working on that , and it is good , today I understand why nitin gadkari talking and doing these works man , congress did mistakes, now india facing problem
Sab lok acha kam karenge aur apne apne field me star banenge to desh apne aap tarakki karega..
In india all free schemes runs the state  governments..
And we are betting on green hydrogen and ammonia hope in future it will give fruitful results
Awesome vdo
We offer the world more brains, which will give us remittance to improve!
“Leverage”. 
Ppl are  behaving like we r sitting idle and doing nothing,Govt is working on many infra projects and bringing MNCs,follow infranews defence news,pr kyu negative hi hona hai hamesa
They're also leading in tokamak technology. They're investing in the future and we're nowhere near them.

India needs to get into A.I and automation  to catch up or it will become dependent on other nations.
Well instead giving Freebies to the public, we need to give it to companies in selected industries of future, who have enough potential to do something like these Chinese companies.

Im the first graduate in my family, The game of economics started late in India compared to china., We must think longterm in multiple fields, but energy is one sector we must exert our dominance, Russia is Having leverage in Ukraine war just because of its resources, if we could bring down the cost of energy and find the alternatives to Fossil fuels, we would surely have a bright future. and Focus on the Human Resources must be a priority, people must be taught to think, innovate, improve their personal health. Caste system must be abolished. Multiple streams of Income must be encouraged. There is a lot which can be done right and I storngly think few years down the line with right political leaders, India can be greater than china.
Legends will know Thumbnail is Changed . Nehru was  there instead of mr. Singh

Green Hydrogen going to dominate after 20yr?
I dont think India can have that growth solely because the govt system is democracy and most of the time and energy for a whole year after every 5 years is spent on winning next elections. india will grow but what took china 40 years india will take 80 years
Green hydrogen,bio fuel is going to be india's leverage in next decade
China is 1 govt 1 rule, the reforms gets implemented easily unlike India multipolitcs politcs ; federal system politcs; free speech politics; politics in name of democracy thus implement the reforms takes years due to stay in supreme court.
Chinese were busy  to develop relation with congo for business whereas In India  indian politicians were busy in vote bank,  state  election, nagar nigam election filling their bank account as they have only five years to them.... Democracy in India 
Futuristic thinking towards nation development is good but don't compare with India
I had no idea Korea is located in Russia. 
This reminds me of it is just like how the Brits and Americans extracted the oils from the Iraq and iran 
Democracy sure is very important and suitabe for India, but it doesn't allow our leaders to think long term.... they only think to retain votes for next election,... thats where their focus is instead of developing the economy.
We have nothing except saffron politics 
Good topic to ponder. Your last sentence a debatable one makes me ask you  another video on rise of china and their ethics.
Please do for South korea
One video on delhi model also ..,as Mr kejrival is expanding so we want an unbiased analysis of his government
Music is too loud bro please keep it low it put some people off
This is how China dominant 
By seeing this video..i was getting angry over our governments..and people who caste their vote based on money.
谢谢你，让我更加了解我的国家。
Human population is a Resource, until tapped
What happen to indian think tank...?
Where do we see india if he would given some power in india Policy framework
We need leader like चीन
In democracy we can't do this because if one government takes 15-20 years long term plan ... Other government would come and stop it .... Stable and strong government is only option for development
If only Indians thought this way and so far ahead
Looking at our government and mindset they are preparing our people, we are going backwards. Our development stopped since our government’s included religions in politics. We just came out of caste based politics and started focusing on economics but our politicians are busy in religious riots and winning elections. China focused on infrastructure and become top 2 country in terms of everything and everything is owned by Chinese govt. we are selling everything to private companies and only 2 people of our country are getting richer day by day. Also both counties rules and regulations are same. We should focus on infrastructure and economy boosting plans rather than religions. Someone said “religion is how we choose to live/guide our life”
I agree India population is liability not the power,..most of them depend on freebiees like AAP in Delhi and India has too much freedom that we misuse it.
India became this of under developed because nehru's thought
India needs to take R&D seriously..solar may not be the future of electricity but nuclear maybe..if nuclear then thorium based can be the safer option..India has the largest reserves of thorium but still there is not an efficient way to use if India can pioneer here, that can be  something great..
its 19.9 trillion not 17!!
Pls make some long vedio
Us bet on oil.
In India people love to play politics everywhere.  But Chinese people's favorite sport is 'mind your own buisness'.
I believe one of the main reasons for this is the authoritarian regime.
India: Software industry ig
That is the right question
The  govt of India vision had been till the next elections.
What china did requires long term planning and efficient execution. In india our politicians have mainly focused on “panchvarshi yojna” to get the votes in next election. 
India mai toh adani port bana raha hai aur rice bag community protest .... Kaise hoga development
Data might be the biggest oil in the next 20 yrs for AI reinforcement govt should invest in developing world's best Infra to other countries to invests and with in 10 yrs we can charge them with reasonable amount that we can benifit
Investments in Instracture and manufacturing sector helped in providing jobs and improved finacial status of general public but the bubble has started collapsing now. After 2 years you will come up next video The Rise And Fall Of Chinese Economy.
India is investing heavily on semi conductor and hydrogen fuel, Ambani and adani will invest around 150 billion dollar in hydrogen fuel.
The problem is India has opposition, In china there is no opposition so implementation is most faster than Indian implementations.
china's ministers and oppositions 
V good
Hydrogen mission will play key role in the Indian economy in the next 20 years

No one in the Comments Should Comment on India now we can inspire from them but not Copy them Coz we are Democracy
I didn't find any new information as I thought
Is their not possible to India to as like as China in solar energy and give competition to China??????
This blow my mind whooo
Johnny Harris inspired !!!!
I think china is like a bright student on the wrong path
Goal in 2050 they will be advanced developed country with decline in their population and a relatively rich and wealthy society
China will come back 
No matter what mistake our leader make still we can beat china through hardwork.
How rapidly is he changing thumbnails
Who all noted Microsoft logo in the video
It's 20 trillion not 17 ..
If china want to implement any policy they will do that without any hurdle there will be no protest, no election, no worry of opposition , don't need to appease anyone but still take 30 years so india will take 50 years to reach that position or maybe 20 years  where china is right
We have problems and I'm okay with the pace...c'z when you hear stories from ground in China, the cost of human life and individual rights is not something to be joulous of... Let's not compare our self with someone else..china is very different from India geographically and demographically so let's go with our elephant 
I dont know why ppl think that india wants to b like china. There r many different ways to eradicate poverty we dont necessarily have to follow china, usa, etc. countries models.
Study material?
I guess India is betting on hydrocarbon
You know it's easy to implement all these policy when you have only one party and homogeneous culture with unlimited state power ...india never can be china . If that offends you...let it be...i am a nationalist but rationalist as well..
Reservations based on caste system will always keep pulling India down
15:00
The current govt is trying hard to build the infrastructure but it most likely make our economy to 1/3 of the Chinese. What we are doing now should have been done long time ago. India’s sole effort wont help much now, it will only be beneficial if investors in  China think that there is too much monopoly. Even then, China has got everything in its grip..!!
India's multi party system..
But instead of this scheme government is more concerned in offering reservation to people in  various states we have around 70% reservation how can we even plan to grow as nation if we have cancer like this
The Chinese always have had long term plannings and because of their single party system then can successfully implement them too.
USA offered support to China as rival to USSR, that's the reason for China's growth
We bought stuff they got rich

India is beating on green energy (specially hydrogen will be game changer). Digitalisation.
Ch. Nehru accha dikh raha tha thumbnail mein, kyu remove kiya??
China liberalised it's economy in 1978,we did it in 1991,Time is also very important,those who are blaming current govt. for economic troubles shud know china start was not very good but early,therefore we can now only catchup with china if there is again a ww3 bw china and USA
What position pakistan has in comparison of india same india has in comparison with china 
India will do with it Manpower
We know this
People are talking about one party state, well there are other failed countries like North Korea,  whereas there are other countries like south Korea, japan, USA, france, Uk, Canada, taiwan, singapore, new zealand, and there are many more which are examples of how democracies can thrive, even though the ruling parties keep changing, yet they have high GDP per capita, high standards of living, and quality education, that even people from our own countries are leaving there to live. It is not about the system, it is about governance, We can see in debates Indian politics is and has always been about vote politics, none of the politicians come and talk about Education? Because they know  it very well it wont get them seats. We have a huge population and we do not have an R and D culture people are still moving out of the country for research because of better opportunities and better standard of living and a prosperous future. Well it is harsh but it true.
Atleast chinese govt dont have to think about next elections ...
no matter you have democracy or dictatorship only visionary leaders can change country so vote wisely
Extreme socialism is like adding extra salt on food
Kejriwal should understand it and should not give free electricity and  other things
Why 1 dislikes
India can never go China route because of our political differences, demographic differences, anti India elements thriving here with full privileges..India has been peace lover, lost a huge territory to China as well as Pakistan.. lost the key resources, land routes to Central Asia and created a national security threat for itself by allowing China Pakistan nexus..
India should focus on solar and Nuclear plants...
When China was doing all these what was India and GoI doing ? Sleeping ?
After China becomes a developed country by 2050 next is India's turn!!
India is not losing. It’s playing the same strategy that China had back then.
so green hydrogen is our take
We are busy in election only 
Before taking the existing population into advantage. Central government should as fast as possible bring population control bill.

Green hydrogen fuel may be.......
China is saving the world , in abroad  many save money because of buying china gadgets electronics , otherwise USA canada uK made costs 5 times more
What india should learn from China? 
No one looks at the things happened in the background.. Nobdy gives a fuck of the hardships, misery, blood and toil they have given to achieve this feat.. Everyone sees this Sentiliting present which they are rejoicing now... Everyone talks abt the theory but not the practice.. What they did and achieve, it's hard to replicate
isn't India already a super power though? does having nukes not automagically make you a world super power. pretty low bar since North Korea also has some.
Get over with differences atleast now.. bc ldte reh jaoge.. and some other country will steal the prize.. we need to be serious and make the most efficient use of our demographic dividend in industrial revolution 4.0

China use it's population in right way.

India shows a very clear example of what would China be like had China 
China is going to be most powerful country world has seen in thousands of years.
We have religion leverage
@ThinkSchool, democracy comes with a cost and I think you should stop comparing China and INDIA. For a single Telecom bill, you started using words like a dictatorship. As you grow, you are becoming one of the existing media
The biggest disadvantage india has is the socialist policies we still have. The welfare schemes and freebies. The vote bank policies. Don’t forget that china had to rule with an iron fist and quash any relevant protests of their ppl to reach this economic stage. They committed crimes on its own citizens and used many less than honourable ways to rise. Censoring, propaganda, surveillance, debt trapping, blatantly ripping off products, etc. We need to strike a balance. We need to let ppl lift themselves out of poverty rather govt providing them direct money or freebies. The government’s top priority should be job creation. And we Indians need to get rid of the lazy attitude that govt should do everything for us and start working hard. That’s one thing you can’t criticise the Chinese, they are extremely hard working. We need to strike that work life balance at a national level lol. As Tata said, I don’t want india to be a happy nation more than a wealthy nation.
I believe within India within states internal atmosphere created is not inspiring our youth towards research,,, zero logic TV debates is something needs to be changed
Only one Answer..DEMOCRAZY
People says India is going to surpass China. In reality India is running behind 30 years from china. Though people applaud economic liberalization in 1992, but it was a forced process. Without manufacturing infrastructure it was like a premature ejaculation. It was good for foreign investors, but not that much beneficial for India.
if we put religion outside India then we will be the same
Ganesh but what about the humongous number of people who died in this China's industrial revolution ?
nitn gadkari visted chine in 2017 18 he said that there is nothing communism in china it is a supergrowig country people have freedom and all that actually a stable goverment play a very very crucial role in nation building and boosting economy like the current bjp goverment is boosting the economy.. we need stable governemnt like bjp
India too can grow but only if our gujrati pm help every state like china did. We must follow China not Sri lanka 
India is leveraging human population, in 20years we will the top manpower supplier to world.
Indians when compared to Pakistan: 
Kuch bhi kaho china h toh mind blowing
Software developers
But indians will still compare the country with pakistan rather than china even Bangladesh is ahead of our economy
Ok how manmohan made good policies about India?
The first thing which India needs to learn from them is to become a communist and offer the same lucrative deals to the foreign investors.. Make strict rules which people will have to follow. China's success story wouldn't have been possible if it was a democracy like India.   In India there is a protest for everything . In China a protest is greeted with army tanks like it did in Tianman Square. . So Indians including think school should ask . Are we ready to become a communist nation ?
What was india doing all this time
Hydrogen and solar are the future.
India is superpower saar. India invented flying vimanans & Also first internet used during Mahabharata times. And hanuman was 1st person to go near sun that too without Oxygen.
They have got money and economy but on cost of their freedom.......will  you trade your freedom for money
British taught us divide and rule. Dont let the illiterate learn. Keep them in the way they are. Even now same thing is happening.. since 1947, till now. Politics is the reason.

We Indians still fighting for caste , relegion, reservation. God
Problem with india is caste system which play vital role in suppressing 25-50% of people  who wer dalit, minority and middle class hindus. So india output 50% less always. And proverty never fade away.
Why indian like to make a video about China or that include China? I never seen Chinese made many videos to talk about india.
When china was liberalising in 1979, our Congress party and socialist communist parties were busy distributing freebies and still some people votes for khujliwaal and INC. shame

Think School, you have forgotten to think one valid point, China follows communism & dictatorship but India follows democracy. So, its completely nonsense to compare China with India.
Bhakts come over here. Our hunger rate is 127 in 10 years 
China is a Communist country, we don't want dictators here. They have taken a hard approach, it has worked for them. Their approach towards developement is totally different from democratic country like India. There is no point in comparing India with China. 
To all of us here, just look at the developed nation, they will more or less would have a stable govt,
Yeeee!!!!
China's system can never be applied to India. For example, Since 1980s Chinese government used to perform the abortion of the every second child of a couple! Can you imagine this in India? Evey labour should work atleast 12 hours per day. There are no elections in China, unlike India where there is major election for every 6 months. Most of the time of politicians goes in to this. All the energy, money, resources goes to election winning, rather than actual development.
Because china was led by the greatest Asian statesman of modern era deng Xiaoping since 70s. India never got an equivalent to him in leadership. He didn't speak much and silently worked for China's future for 10-15 years. 
Op
Hi Everybody, how many agree Think School is best and Ganesh is best teacher

Even with many of its so called allies,together they r no match as compare with the dragon combine with bear & now the tiger of east (Taiwan), it's just a walk over.

To all here, this is ground reality, though it is stone to digest, 
India needs to inforce the CBDC (central bank digital currency) and expand the bhim upi and digital payment system that we can replace the Swift system . that is the leverage that india can gain over the world
If Indian government goes to invest  5 billion in times of recession in something that is going to be fruitful in decades ,then we the people will be standing in the way of the government. In democracy it’s hard for government too , like our pm  have to focus on winning elections with governance .

Why get so excited about some else's formula and without knowing if it stands the test of time? 100/200 years or less of an experiment doesn't really prove anything, India is a time tested society and a collective of amazing people ( specifically the rural ), it's so organic and natural that your young (2-300 years old ) theories would be simply consumed to oblivion. Wait, watch & tune yourself and observe an amazing amalgamation of the ancient with the future. Tune!!!
This is why Modi is a failure. I am from Gujarat. I have been hearing about solar in Modi's speech since 2007. Result ? He made India the biggest consumer of solar panels . No significant effort on making Solar panels .

yep, but forget to mention that economy of a communist can grow double the size of democratic country due to rules and regulation. plus china most faulty thing is that they have state based only for one sector so. if one goes berserk then whole region.

When the United States talks about "rules-based international order," it actually means "an international order based on U.S. hegemonic control."

Londons insurance industry runs the risk of destroying hundreds of years dominance by following these insurance sanctions. It will allow opportunities for Chinese companies and others to enter the market and once lost they will never be regained.

The purpose is not to cripple the economy of Russia. The target is Europe with their insurance industries being hit hard. EU does not mind, they happily become an agriculture sector. Fits nicely in their climate policies.

No insurance cover for Russian crude carriers? China, India & other Asian beneficiaries of cheap Russian oil can earmark a percentage of their profits to set up a new insurance organisation to provide cover.

OMG! We are SHOCKED again!!!
Ultimate power of Russia.
Road runner Rusia does it again. Coyote smarts (uS) fails again.
If only Russian oil is capped and Russia refuses to supply oil to hostile countries this will create an oil shortage which will increase the price of oil supplied by other OPEC countries. Surely this shortage will force countries to seek oil from any country including Russia especially at a capped price. I cant see the cap working except against the western countries. Yes it might reduce Russia’s economy but I doubt if it will destroy it. All I can see is that the oil from other OPEC countries will skyrocket
It's not a "buycott" it's a "boycott". "Boycott" is when some group REFUSES collectively to buy from you. A "buycott" is when some group ONLY buys from you.

When the United States talks about "rules-based international order," it actually means "an international order based on U.S. hegemonic control."
A man like Vladimir Putin comes but only once in a thousand years 
Shocked  the  entire  America and  Europe  !  They  need  it  !  They  expect  it  !  All  due  to  the  attitude  of  hegemony  !
Plot twist: Europe buys LNG from America at record high prices. Up to four times their normal amount. They are getting scammed.
Bullying too many countries does not work!
As an American all you can do is laugh.
Londons insurance industry runs the risk of destroying hundreds of years dominance by following these insurance sanctions. It will allow opportunities for Chinese companies and others to enter the market and once lost they will never be regained.
A 5yr old kid could outsmart Biden!
Yes, I like it because your report is more realistic and objectuve. Such kind of reports should be used not for propaganda purposes. Thanks
Each time Zelensky does something considerable to Russia,  there is serious repercussions. How could he ever win.
I wish all peoples of all nations peace and love from a humble American
The purpose is not to cripple the economy of Russia. The target is Europe with their insurance industries being hit hard. EU does not mind, they happily become an agriculture sector. Fits nicely in their climate policies.
Russia with Love
Insurance  is key to understanding  the commercial  truth of this conflict
Good job putin,  show America and European countries what happens when they play dirty,
No insurance cover for Russian crude carriers? China, India & other Asian beneficiaries of cheap Russian oil can earmark a percentage of their profits to set up a new insurance organisation to provide cover.

Indeed our national interest comes first. India is massive developing country rise oil prices directly effects citizens lifestyle. As a neutral country we don’t want to part of proxy wars.
Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money. When it comes to the world of investing,most people don't know where to start.fortunately,great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance
What India does is absolutely right and wise... God is there with innocent always...
Let's find some common ground, allow all of humanity to share on this amazing planet
Putin gave enough chances , now Putin is going for the jugular game over 
Why they are trying to harm a country that is not in war with them?
Amazing videos and thank you for breaking it down!.Despite the economic downturn, I'm so happy I have been earning $ 45,000 returns from my $8,000 investment every 14 days. All thanks to Mrs Sophia
Customers buy oil n it does not care where it comes from as long as the.price  is right n not what  what US  n EU dictstes
India Russia friendship genuine and eternal.. Can never be otherwise
Great reset , in action.
OMG! We are SHOCKED again!!!
Ultimate power of Russia.
Road runner Rusia does it again. Coyote smarts (uS) fails again.
If only Russian oil is capped and Russia refuses to supply oil to hostile countries this will create an oil shortage which will increase the price of oil supplied by other OPEC countries. Surely this shortage will force countries to seek oil from any country including Russia especially at a capped price. I cant see the cap working except against the western countries. Yes it might reduce Russia’s economy but I doubt if it will destroy it. All I can see is that the oil from other OPEC countries will skyrocket
It's not a "buycott" it's a "boycott". "Boycott" is when some group REFUSES collectively to buy from you. A "buycott" is when some group ONLY buys from you.

Remember the old movie "The Wizard of Oz". Everybody was petrified until toto the dog pulled the curtain back. Russia is like that dog and now we all see what's behind the curtain and it's not that scary - pathetic WEF, dying EU and US and a failed Nato and how pointless their little NGO groups are. Well done Russia and VV Putin the living legend.
Cold winter is the best friend of Russia
OPEC should reduce production to counter this artifical forced reduction in price. 4 million barrels a day output reduction will balance prices and demand.
Nothing is forever
You don't seem to realise how far back does the timetested India-Russia relationship goes ? Or the significance of it... To the days of the USSR and earlier. There is no way India would turns it back on Russia, threats or otherwise.
Jai Hinduja.  We Indians are happy to do arbitrage oil trades between Russia and Europe.  Only we  can provide as much Petrorupee to Russia as Putin wants.
Go Russia
Tell the US and EU to enjoy their price cap and higher energy prices. Russia has said it won't comply with their bullying and consequently they won't receive oil or gas. Let other companies do the insurance work and replace UK dominated insurance. This doesn't look good for the west. Also if they do this with energy, what will stop their lunacy in price capping food etc.
Maybe their trains can run on unicorn seamen
Well done dear president Putin. Ones is so proud of you. God bless Russians.
Long term Russia will be the first country to loose its oil export, it takes time to develop green technologies.
Will Crude Oil rise in 2023?
The entire transportation system of Russia from commercial planes, trains, cars, Farm machines etc etc etc no longer has spare parts. 
Russia India Oil Deal!
Russia has its own fleet of 100-plus tankers so is not affected by the insurance embargo and once out of Russia, the oil will lose its identity, just like the oil the US steals from Syria once it has been passed through refineries in Turkey. Neither the EU nor US will be able to distinguish refined oil products like diesel coming from refineries in India or the Middle East from Middle East oil and the profit motive is such that traders will mask the origin. So another elf inflicted wound to the EU economy by the dolts in Brussels.

Sorry,  but this video is based on wishful and delusional thinking. Russia's economy is tiny (roughly the same size as that of Spain) compared to that of the West - and is predicted to shrink by nearly 20% by the end of 2023 (with the effects of mass conscription being the single biggest factor). It's a vastly unequal contest that Russia is inevitably losing.

Now with the recent economy, To get Financial FREEDOM  you have to be making money while you're asleep.
Just stumbled upon this channel. Very dry and based presentation. Like it.
Putin just revealed NOTHING 
Where u have read owner of house has to follow neighbors rules in his home?

If oil producer sell too high prices to China and India good and services can u all pay for higher goods and services ??
Great work of China Russia
Decisively.

No wonder why the world goes so bad! Leaders pulling the blanket on their sides when it would be easier to share. What the earth gives should belong to all.

So we going to.capped goals diamond timbers and fruits from other we don't like I hope the Russian react soon
If tech revolution was that wise and knowledgible in this 8sdue , surely they would had known or predicted it's outcomes . Surprising the hadn't done so. Which I surmised they're not good at what they do .
I hear nothing about putin revealed a lot of old news
Thing is that G7 came to belief that they own UN. On the other side you have BRIX, representing 85% of humans on Earth. G7 has to realize that what they want is not what world needs and their rules are what vast majority of population has to abide to, only so they keep the same living standards as in colonial times of plundering. Excluding ex-UK, and now ex-US colonies (UK, EU, Japan, South Korea, Australia), everyone else works together in their own fair-trading world, avoiding printed US dollars and actually producing goods, in factories, for real oil and gas, delivering commodity to citizens and having products to sell. 
India can listen to usa or west, if they agree to indian demands.

dream is free, enjoy!
They're rather helping RUSSIA to grow.
BRICS banks can give insurance. also who wants to sell oil in printed dollars?. oil better bartered for gold silver or rice
It's nonsense to release their secret
Russia already stated that they are not going to supply oil to any customer who participates in the oil cap and China and India also declared that they would not cooperate.
It isn't big news in the UK
Isn't Saudi Arabia trying to strengthen relationships with Russia ?
not, their going through other countries and still getting russian oil, that includes the u.s.
I wish ALL CITIZENS OF EVERY COUNTRY WOULD AWAKEN AND TAKE OUT OR GO AFTER ALL GOVERNMENT OR POLITICS , AND THE PROBLEMS WOULD LIGHTEN UP OR GO AWAY IN GENERAL
i, for one, refuse to watch any video that doesn't have "SHOCKED" in the title.

It's a vastly unequal contest that Russia is inevitably losing.
Oil tanker owners may sell  them off
You need to out him and bring him to justice 
Thanks for the good laugh. I'll subscribe.
SO WHERE IS THE ACTUAL COUNTER STRIKE PLAN YOU PROMISED IN THE HEADLINE????
Now with the recent economy, To get Financial FREEDOM  you have to be making money while you're asleep.
Just stumbled upon this channel. Very dry and based presentation. Like it.
Putin just revealed NOTHING 
Where u have read owner of house has to follow neighbors rules in his home?
Countries mutual interest benefit is the decisive factor.
If oil producer sell too high prices to China and India good and services can u all pay for higher goods and services ??
Great work of China Russia
Decisively.
First usd and now insurance companies. They try monopoly but will work 180 degree in two years time.
No wonder why the world goes so bad! Leaders pulling the blanket on their sides when it would be easier to share. What the earth gives should belong to all.
🧐
So we going to.capped goals diamond timbers and fruits from other we don't like I hope the Russian react soon
If tech revolution was that wise and knowledgible in this 8sdue , surely they would had known or predicted it's outcomes . Surprising the hadn't done so. Which I surmised they're not good at what they do .
I hear nothing about putin revealed a lot of old news
Thing is that G7 came to belief that they own UN. On the other side you have BRIX, representing 85% of humans on Earth. G7 has to realize that what they want is not what world needs and their rules are what vast majority of population has to abide to, only so they keep the same living standards as in colonial times of plundering. Excluding ex-UK, and now ex-US colonies (UK, EU, Japan, South Korea, Australia), everyone else works together in their own fair-trading world, avoiding printed US dollars and actually producing goods, in factories, for real oil and gas, delivering commodity to citizens and having products to sell. 
India can listen to usa or west, if they agree to indian demands.
Well done Putin..
The westerns are lost they don’t know what to do next they doing the same mistakes and end up paying the price 
dream is free, enjoy!
They're rather helping RUSSIA to grow.
BRICS banks can give insurance. also who wants to sell oil in printed dollars?. oil better bartered for gold silver or rice
It's nonsense to release their secret
Russia already stated that they are not going to supply oil to any customer who participates in the oil cap and China and India also declared that they would not cooperate.
It isn't big news in the UK
Isn't Saudi Arabia trying to strengthen relationships with Russia ?
not, their going through other countries and still getting russian oil, that includes the u.s.
I wish ALL CITIZENS OF EVERY COUNTRY WOULD AWAKEN AND TAKE OUT OR GO AFTER ALL GOVERNMENT OR POLITICS , AND THE PROBLEMS WOULD LIGHTEN UP OR GO AWAY IN GENERAL
i, for one, refuse to watch any video that doesn't have "SHOCKED" in the title.
The Eu should put a price cap on gas and oil coming from the USA
Deal now INVADE later.
Even monkeys will not urinate on dollars.
Putin is fighting the Cabal for us
This message comes two weeks to late
Endmerica , nato , Europe must be taught a lesson .
Times for a used the nuclear power atomic bombs started 
Oil is done, Russia is done.
The final analysis is simple....The European countries will become a gigantic Freezer and all the common peoples will become Frozen Chicken 
Putin is the best way
Western consumers did not turn from Russian oil, western governments did.
Where is democracy in OIL?
Many years ago the Jews were only allowed a few jobs. One of them was money lending but there was a lending cap on how much they could charge. Well it back fired big time. People would only loan from them. Other lenders went broke. You may find the same will happen with Russia. What they lack in price they may be able to make up in volume while still not selling to the g7 countries. And bloody good job.
I went to the Tesla dealer and put a much needed price cap on a brand new Tesla. 
LOL
Allaha Rabb Ul Alamin is one creator Of universe / owners of. Whatever you Own belongs to Him. POWER you Have From him, is a Test for you?  How do goanna use It?
I love and want to pay 40$ a gallon in gas in usa
what if Biden - Putin trade swap instead
The west should not impose price cap because that opens the door to other commodities being capped due to West dislike and sanctions.
EU DONT WANT TO BE DEPENDANT OF RUSSIA NOW THEY ARE DEPENDANT OF USA AND PAY 4 TIME MORE, WE ALL SOMEHOW DEPENDANT OF SOMEONE FROM SOMEWHERE SO IT IS NORMAL AS LONG THE PRICE AND QUALITY ARE RIGHT
OPEC oil producing CARTELS, because it's not listening to the west jihahhahah 
I hope my country's Philippines would also buy russia oil.
Let the economy collapse
If EU and NATO Safocate Russia than Russia can use Nuclear weapon and Russia has full right to do it.
Too much explanation without any point.
Economic embargo has no effect on Russia you cannot just contain Russia because at the moment Russia is wealthier than the United States and Europe
Cut food imports to Russia, from as many countries as possible !
if they wanted to shopt Vladimir Putin the US should of kept going with Donald Trump's policy now look at US how far are they willing to fall EU no better
When the United States talks about "rules-based international order," it actually means "an international order based on U.S. hegemonic control."
A man like Vladimir Putin comes but only once in a thousand years 
Shocked  the  entire  America and  Europe  !  They  need  it  !  They  expect  it  !  All  due  to  the  attitude  of  hegemony  !
Plot twist: Europe buys LNG from America at record high prices. Up to four times their normal amount. They are getting scammed.
Bullying too many countries does not work!
As an American all you can do is laugh.
Londons insurance industry runs the risk of destroying hundreds of years dominance by following these insurance sanctions. It will allow opportunities for Chinese companies and others to enter the market and once lost they will never be regained.
A 5yr old kid could outsmart Biden!
Yes, I like it because your report is more realistic and objectuve. Such kind of reports should be used not for propaganda purposes. Thanks
Each time Zelensky does something considerable to Russia,  there is serious repercussions. How could he ever win.
I wish all peoples of all nations peace and love from a humble American
The purpose is not to cripple the economy of Russia. The target is Europe with their insurance industries being hit hard. EU does not mind, they happily become an agriculture sector. Fits nicely in their climate policies.
Russia with Love
Insurance  is key to understanding  the commercial  truth of this conflict
Good job putin,  show America and European countries what happens when they play dirty,
No insurance cover for Russian crude carriers? China, India & other Asian beneficiaries of cheap Russian oil can earmark a percentage of their profits to set up a new insurance organisation to provide cover.

Indeed our national interest comes first. India is massive developing country rise oil prices directly effects citizens lifestyle. As a neutral country we don’t want to part of proxy wars.
Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money. When it comes to the world of investing,most people don't know where to start.fortunately,great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance
What India does is absolutely right and wise... God is there with innocent always...
Let's find some common ground, allow all of humanity to share on this amazing planet
Putin gave enough chances , now Putin is going for the jugular game over 
Why they are trying to harm a country that is not in war with them?
Amazing videos and thank you for breaking it down!.Despite the economic downturn, I'm so happy I have been earning $ 45,000 returns from my $8,000 investment every 14 days. All thanks to Mrs Sophia
Customers buy oil n it does not care where it comes from as long as the.price  is right n not what  what US  n EU dictstes
India Russia friendship genuine and eternal.. Can never be otherwise
Great reset , in action.
OMG! We are SHOCKED again!!!
Ultimate power of Russia.
Road runner Rusia does it again. Coyote smarts (uS) fails again.
If only Russian oil is capped and Russia refuses to supply oil to hostile countries this will create an oil shortage which will increase the price of oil supplied by other OPEC countries. Surely this shortage will force countries to seek oil from any country including Russia especially at a capped price. I cant see the cap working except against the western countries. Yes it might reduce Russia’s economy but I doubt if it will destroy it. All I can see is that the oil from other OPEC countries will skyrocket
It's not a "buycott" it's a "boycott". "Boycott" is when some group REFUSES collectively to buy from you. A "buycott" is when some group ONLY buys from you.
winter just started , lets see which country survive
World's two worst negotiators, Biden  and Yelen
All I Know is "The United States Empire ended February 24,2022" ,"It's no longer possible for the US to expect the whole World to dance to their tune "From Mother Russia With Love And Most Of The World.
Break even cost for Russian oil is at about $28 to 34 per barrel subject to distance to the major pipeline hub
Western countries caught up in the US led sanction and embargoes are committing economic Hari-Kiri.
America is really determined to bring Russia to heel .
"Don't raise your voice, improve your argument."
Mr . Putin is very Shroud and well disciplined , see ya
Remember the old movie "The Wizard of Oz". Everybody was petrified until toto the dog pulled the curtain back. Russia is like that dog and now we all see what's behind the curtain and it's not that scary - pathetic WEF, dying EU and US and a failed Nato and how pointless their little NGO groups are. Well done Russia and VV Putin the living legend.
Cold winter is the best friend of Russia
OPEC should reduce production to counter this artifical forced reduction in price. 4 million barrels a day output reduction will balance prices and demand.
Nothing is forever
You don't seem to realise how far back does the timetested India-Russia relationship goes ? Or the significance of it... To the days of the USSR and earlier. There is no way India would turns it back on Russia, threats or otherwise.
Jai Hinduja.  We Indians are happy to do arbitrage oil trades between Russia and Europe.  Only we  can provide as much Petrorupee to Russia as Putin wants.
Go Russia
Tell the US and EU to enjoy their price cap and higher energy prices. Russia has said it won't comply with their bullying and consequently they won't receive oil or gas. Let other companies do the insurance work and replace UK dominated insurance. This doesn't look good for the west. Also if they do this with energy, what will stop their lunacy in price capping food etc.
Maybe their trains can run on unicorn seamen
Well done dear president Putin. Ones is so proud of you. God bless Russians.
Long term Russia will be the first country to loose its oil export, it takes time to develop green technologies.
Will Crude Oil rise in 2023?
The entire transportation system of Russia from commercial planes, trains, cars, Farm machines etc etc etc no longer has spare parts. 
Russia India Oil Deal!
Russia has its own fleet of 100-plus tankers so is not affected by the insurance embargo and once out of Russia, the oil will lose its identity, just like the oil the US steals from Syria once it has been passed through refineries in Turkey. Neither the EU nor US will be able to distinguish refined oil products like diesel coming from refineries in India or the Middle East from Middle East oil and the profit motive is such that traders will mask the origin. So another elf inflicted wound to the EU economy by the dolts in Brussels.

Sorry ur voice is demoralising
Russia invaded Ukraine in this war so blame Russia
Easy way around the insurance is Russia just offers the Insurance to those companies it is not like that the EU insurance companies are the only ones that can offer insurance any one with money can do it.
.LOL what bollox , Russia can't crash a Lada let alone the world economy
Interesting video. What I'd like to see from either vertical take off or landing is the transition from vertical and horizontal movement.
Got to watch Apollo 10 to 17 from Brevard County. 10 - 13 from just 12 miles away. What a glorious machine especially the night launch of 17.
scientist: this isnt enough manuver ability in high speeds.
Any country with talented people can build this type of plane, eg Germany,Japan,France and many countries
Sweden is also able to build such jets, look at the SAAB JAS Gripen.
If you haven't had a closeup of Russia  kit, you might be forgiven for not realising that they are utter junk.
Thrust vectoring wasn't really designed for dog fights. it was mainly used for high altitude maneuvers where the plane's flight surfaces have less effect due to less air molecules to work with. Trying to dog fight against fighters with modern missiles is suicidal.
wow...sangat canggih mister
Given the absence of industrial espionage, both Russia and China would be severely disadvantaged to build anything claiming to be 5th or even 6th generation!
russia couldnt build a brick wall without the bricks and cement getting nicked
Russia is the innovator, the tech leader. Just bought a Russian EV, amazing.
I believe more that only the US is and has been capable of building such a high-tech stealth plane, Russia does make planes, but conventional ones, and China lives off the theft of technology, but it is still very far from this technology, remember that the US tried Their first stealth planes in 1989 during the invasion of Panama, and they entered without problems and in the IRAQ war in the same way, they have only shot down a single stealth plane and it was due to the pilot's forgetfulness that he forgot to close the hatch
Is this an old video? It mostly only talks about Fighter jets from the last century.
The Soviets may of claimed to have made the first ones with the Fulcrum or flanker but did they get the idea of thrust vectoring from from the flying bedstead that Rolls-Royce designed for jet powered VTOL ? They also copied the P.1154 Hawker Siddeley supersonic engine which is what the F35B uses today and realised that the nozzle on the afterburners could direct the thrust! 
Sooo, did he ever say specifically why only the US and Russia can build this stuff?
Why are people still discussing and wasting lots of money on old concepts and technology?  Unmanned aerial vehicles with advanced sensor technology and AI systems are capable of performing maneuvers that no human could endure, and do it at a lower cost and with greater capabilities.  The age of the dogfight is quickly coming to an end with stand-off weapons and AI systems.
Two other nations can build this kind of tech, Japan and China
lets just built a plane and slap the word 5th gen and stealth on it just like how we slap hypersonic on our missiles. 
🎉
In the future Indonesia is also capable of making fighter jets

Delhi was considerably better under Sheila Dixit than under you.
To become a truly national party, AAP must embrace a policy of having the best, honest, clean, intelligent, well qualified, visionary, courageous, good people as its face, in the lead.
Those people who can partition a country into 2 are not a minority but a well organized group
Jay Jay ho AAP 
Congratulations to all the leaders and we also in Kerala waiting for you . God Bless
Best actor award should be given to him

It is really good news to hear that APP is become as a National party. The growth of APP is drastic in a decade. And I really like the Delhi Economic Policy of APP because of which is much like Dravidian Economic Policy of Tamil Nadu.

AAP is mainly a Party of Purvanchal & Bihar people, that's why Delhi is their stronghold as most jobseekers  come from this area.
Please maintain peace in Delhi and that istself will be a great achievement and people will blindly follow you in every state

Delhi was considerably better under Sheila Dixit than under you.
To become a truly national party, AAP must embrace a policy of having the best, honest, clean, intelligent, well qualified, visionary, courageous, good people as its face, in the lead.
Those people who can partition a country into 2 are not a minority but a well organized group

Thanks for sharing your thoughts guys. people are always curious about why someone is helping us. In my humble opinion, Sri Lanka has always been a kingdom of generosity. People there are generous too. Did anyone wonder why the Sri Lankan were so generous to others? That's the way of good karma. People near and far appreciate you. If anyone study how Buddhism came to Sri Lanka, you'd know why the Sri Lankan are good brothers and sisters to all their neighbors. It's no accident that the Indian people are so fond of Sri Lankan. So are the Thai and the Chinese among many others. Best fortunes to all.
I really like the idea of building a new city from nothing. This way it is possible to innovate without the restriction of old concepts and chose the most efficient design for modern living.
How about a metro rail network with many lines that will allow all citizens to gain access to all parts of the city and is being built to be the cities transportation backbone.  Then light rail and trolly and BRT routes to also make mass transit the preferred most convenient way of travel.....
Good.  Sri Lanka and China joint cooperation in the modern mega port with many other facilities to make Sri Lanka Great Again. Sri Lanka people should be appreciative of China help to revive Sri Lanka badly affected economy.  India closest neighbour didn't have the means to help Sri Lanka development. US is only keen to make use of Sri Lanka port for military purposes to control the Indian Ocean and not providing financial aids to Sri Lanka.
👍
Amazing creation by the Chinese!!!
By that by the city should be set up with hundred percent rooftop solar!!!!
GOOD CHINA. MODI KI  KI NEEND HARAM KER RAHA HAI. SHRILANKA PORT SHRILANKA KA BUSINESS ECONOMY. POWER ME HOGI
And here in my inddia majority of people still d0nt have access t0 t0ilet and clean drinking water
That city isn't effecting anything until it gains a major highway tunnel and railway trunk line tunnel to India and the rest of the world that will allow it to improve its own roads and rail infrastructure to become more efficient.
North of Russia is Very Cold; China is at southern part of small Mongolia which is immediately south of Russia.
No Indian welfare to Sri Lanka,  thus only China's charity and trade can feed / sustain them.
Sounds like a place for super-rich. What about bringing prosperity to the general population?  Or are they expected to hold the usual service jobs for the wealthy?
(Brothers of Islam, please do not ignore my message) In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He is alive and does not die in his hand is good and he is the fateOver all things there is no god but God, in recognition of his lordship, glory be to God, especially for his greatnessAnd the Merciful of the Hereafter, O Allah, I amI ask you that praise be to you, there is no god but you, glory be to you, the creator of the heavens and the earth, the possessor of majesty and dignity, with your mercy, the most merciful of the merciful. Who does not please but God's grace is greater is not like himNothing is in the earth or in the heavens, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Yemeni IDPs from Taiz and I live Annawamy and my brothers Sgar our fatherHe passed away, may God have mercy on him, and we have no one in this world standing by our side in this harsh circumstance. I do not have older brothers. I am the eldest among my brothers, but I am a girl. Like you, I cannot go to work among men and spend on my family. By God, then, by God, my brother, we have spent two days deprived of my livelihood and with me are young brothers. Look how their condition is, I swear to GodThe house is on the street, and they saw the neighbors eating, and they stood at their door to give them, even if their bread was dry, they would be quenched by their hunger. By God, who has the king of the heavens and the earth, they closed the door and expelled them and came back to cry and die of hunger. No one had mercy on them and gave them a livingAnd I want you to help, for the sake of God, I adjure you by God and Muhammad is the Messenger of God, who love goodness and help me, even for 500 Yemeni riyals, to send a WhatsApp message to this number
China will own Sri Lanka eventually as the megaproject proceeds at every stage. What China really want is a strategic military staging area in the Indian Ocean for its naval and underwater assets now disguised as a wonderful waterfront housing project.
ANOTHER EVERGRANDE   ??? 
So CCP's can move in there and leave Taiwan+West Taiwan for One Taiwan Policy??...

Happy to see that  a  lot  of work has been done at a fast pace ..but still India needs to intensify its efforts and make faster progress ..for which the govt must take initiative and give orders and finance promptly ...
Wow eagerly waiting till 8022 to get this inducted sure couple of tests would be still pending then also but let's stay hopeful 
Cost effective to long war me sustain kar sakti hai army. Jabki Brahmos tactically effective hai but costly hai. So is type ki system ki value apne aap me kaafi valuable hai. 
How many years will they take to develop the rockets?
Jai Bharat 
MoD  should  support Solar Ind in developing  these rockets.
India should increase Research and Development in Defense sector to face China and Pakistan together in a war
Bro, please share link Nagastra 3 video.. Thank you
It is one of the good news.
Our existing PINAKA lack in range
this solar industries will make only rockets or all system like new MBRL truck etc.?
who is naming this system?
With desi HIMARS & desi S400 pak & china be like
The wrong thing with defence in India is we just aspire a lot ,
How you get information  about  maheswarastra . There is no any article  or news about  this rocket
Ukraine war has demonstrated that both loitering munitions and long range rocket artillery are crucial to winning wars. Need to sort out the mess that is long range rocket artillery.Given the existence of Maheshwarastra 1 of range 150 km while Maheshwarastra 2 range of 250 km. 
JAI BJP NDA 🇮🇳 
isn't 11 crores on the higher side ?
Simple naam rakho nahi export pe kata lagega 
first I read it as Maharashtra

own channel?? Like you are going to pay us for watching your videos lol
The name does sounds like American HIMARS.
Inspired by HIMARS. Due to Ukraine war every nations will developed a capabilities like HIMARS bcause everyone knows its effectiveness and nobody wants Russia grad multiple rocket launcher anymore.
