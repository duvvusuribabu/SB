How do I get into a local deathcore band as a vocalist without being in the scene rn
I used to be friends with Sass before she hit the big time Still love her though and I think she's a great artist. I met her when she was with a local band called The Pin-ups. She played Bass and was the vocalist. They were awesome 😎Good days.

Update 2: It's actually a 70s cover band, playing at the local RSL/pokie palace. Not sure that the Divinyls 'Boys in Town' really works with a male vocalist in the tenor register.
If you're a vocalist, especially in a local metal band and you can't do your vocals/screams live without taking breaks and speaking parts, you probably shouldn't be doing vocals live. Technique matters y'all.
